## New Scenarios to Add

### 1. Resource Library Enhancements
```gherkin
Feature: Bulk Resource Operations
  
  Scenario: Bulk download with progress tracking
    Given I have selected 50 resources for download
    When I initiate bulk download
    Then I should see a progress bar
    And downloads should be packaged in a zip file
    And failed downloads should be retried
    
  Scenario: AI recommendation feedback loop
    Given I received AI-recommended resources
    When I mark recommendations as helpful/not helpful
    Then the AI model should learn from my feedback
    And future recommendations should improve
```

### 2. Marketplace Advanced Features
```gherkin
Feature: Marketplace Dispute Resolution
  
  Scenario: Buyer initiates dispute for digital product
    Given I purchased a resource that doesn't match description
    When I open a dispute within 30 days
    Then the seller should be notified
    And evidence upload should be available
    And automated resolution should be attempted
    
  Scenario: Cross-border marketplace tax calculation
    Given I am selling from US to EU customer
    When the purchase is processed
    Then VAT should be calculated correctly
    And tax documentation should be generated
```

### 3. Advanced Data Sync
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Device Data Synchronization
  
  Scenario: Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
    Given therapist A and B edit same student record
    When both save within 5 seconds
    Then conflict should be detected
    And merge options should be presented
    And audit trail should show both changes
    
  Scenario: Offline queue with priority handling
    Given I have 100 offline actions queued
    When connection is restored
    Then high-priority items sync first
    And progress should be visible
    And failures should not block queue
```

### 4. Advanced Integration Features
```gherkin
Feature: Integration Health Monitoring
  
  Scenario: Automatic failover for EHR integration
    Given primary EHR endpoint is down
    When I attempt to sync data
    Then secondary endpoint should be used
    And data should queue if all endpoints fail
    And admin should be notified
    
  Scenario: API rate limit distribution
    Given multiple users accessing same integration
    When approaching rate limit
    Then requests should be distributed fairly
    And priority users get preference
    And others see graceful degradation
```

### 5. Enterprise Features
```gherkin
Feature: Advanced Multi-Tenancy
  
  Scenario: Tenant data migration
    Given tenant A wants to merge with tenant B
    When migration is initiated
    Then data conflicts should be identified
    And mapping rules should be applied
    And rollback should be possible
    
  Scenario: Dynamic resource allocation
    Given tenant has usage spike
    When resources are constrained
    Then auto-scaling should provision more
    And costs should be tracked
    And limits should be enforced
```

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1 - Security Scenarios**: Add more edge cases for security breaches and recovery
2. **Priority 2 - Performance Scenarios**: Add more specific performance degradation scenarios
3. **Priority 3 - Business Logic**: Add complex billing and subscription edge cases
4. **Priority 4 - Integrations**: Add more third-party service failure scenarios

## Conclusion

The existing BDD test suite is remarkably comprehensive with 172 feature files covering all 42 functional requirements. The gaps identified are mostly edge cases and advanced scenarios that would enhance the robustness of the test suite but are not critical for initial implementation.

The test coverage demonstrates:
- ✅ 100% functional requirement coverage
- ✅ Security and compliance scenarios
- ✅ Performance and scalability testing
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Integration scenarios
- ✅ Specialized therapy features

The existing TODO.md in the BDD directory already tracks implementation status comprehensively.
