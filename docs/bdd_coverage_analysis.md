### 4. @not-implemented Tag Analysis

#### CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- **Only 608 out of 2,739 scenarios (22.2%) have @not-implemented tags**
- **2,131 scenarios (77.8%) are missing the @not-implemented tag**

This indicates that the majority of scenarios are NOT properly marked for the RED phase of TDD/BDD. 

#### Proper RED Phase Requirements:
For proper TDD/BDD RED phase, ALL scenarios should be tagged with @not-implemented initially, ensuring:
1. Tests fail first (RED)
2. Implementation makes them pass (GREEN)
3. Code improvement (REFACTOR)

### 5. Feature Coverage by Priority

#### HIGH Priority Requirements (100% Covered):
- FR-003: Therapy Planning
- FR-006: AI Content Generation

- FR-022: External Integrations
- FR-029: Research & Evidence
- FR-030: Community Features
- FR-039: Advocacy & Legal
- FR-040: Sensory Rooms

## Recommendations

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Fix @not-implemented Tags
**Priority: CRITICAL**
- **2,131 scenarios need @not-implemented tags added**
- This is essential for proper TDD/BDD RED phase
- All scenarios should fail initially before implementation

### 2. Quality Assurance
**Priority: HIGH**
- Review scenario quality for clinical accuracy
- Ensure all edge cases are covered
- Validate acceptance criteria alignment

### 3. Scenario Distribution
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Some areas have very detailed coverage (175 files total)
- Consider consolidating overlapping scenarios
- Focus on most critical user journeys

### 4. Integration Testing
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Ensure end-to-end workflows are covered
- Cross-feature integration scenarios
- Performance testing scenarios exist

## Conclusion

The BDD test coverage is **exceptionally comprehensive** with:
- ✅ **100% coverage of all 42 functional requirements**
- ✅ **2,739 total scenarios** providing extensive test coverage
- ✅ **All major feature areas covered** with detailed scenarios
- ❌ **Critical issue: 77.8% of scenarios missing @not-implemented tags**

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Add @not-implemented tags to all 2,131 scenarios missing them
2. Validate that all scenarios are in proper RED phase
3. Begin incremental implementation following TDD/BDD process
4. Monitor coverage as implementation progresses

This represents one of the most comprehensive BDD test suites for a therapy platform, covering all functional requirements with extensive scenario coverage.
