- Webhook endpoints
- Batch & Async operations
- File management
- Global search
- Push notifications
- Email management
- Data privacy & compliance
- API management & developer tools

## Coverage Percentage

### By Functional Requirements:
- **Covered**: 17 out of 42 (40.5%)
- **Not Covered**: 25 out of 42 (59.5%)

### By API Endpoints:
- **Covered**: ~275 endpoints (46.6%)
- **Not Covered**: ~315 endpoints (53.4%)

## Critical Gaps

### High Priority Missing Features:
1. **Interactive Digital Activities (FR-009)** - Core feature for student engagement
2. **EHR Integration (FR-010)** - Critical for healthcare workflow
3. **Assessment & Screening (FR-015)** - Essential for evaluations
4. **Multilingual Support (FR-019)** - Required for diverse populations
5. **Outcome Measurement (FR-032)** - Required for insurance/compliance

### Infrastructure Gaps:
1. No real-time/WebSocket features defined
2. No batch processing scenarios
3. No file management workflows
4. No API key management
5. No webhook integrations

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Missing Core Features**:
   - Create feature files for FR-009 (Interactive Digital Activities)
   - Create feature files for FR-015 (Assessment & Screening)
   - Create feature files for FR-032 (Outcome Measurement)

2. **Add Infrastructure Features**:
   - Create feature file for real-time updates
   - Create feature file for file management
   - Create feature file for batch operations

3. **Complete Partial Coverage**:
   - Expand parent-portal.feature to cover all communication tools
   - Add more scenarios to notifications feature

4. **Add System-Level Features**:
   - Health monitoring
   - API management
   - Data privacy workflows

## Conclusion

While we have created comprehensive Gherkin scenarios for 40.5% of the functional requirements, significant gaps remain. The missing 59.5% includes critical features like interactive activities, assessments, and multilingual support that are essential for a complete pediatric therapy platform.

The existing feature files provide excellent coverage for authentication, resource management, marketplace, and specialized therapy tools. However, to achieve the full vision outlined in CLAUDE.md, we need to create approximately 25 more feature files covering the remaining functional requirements.
