## Critical Gaps Analysis

### High Priority Missing Workflows (CRITICAL/HIGH priority FRs without workflows):
1. **FR-002: Resource Library** - Core feature without search/filter workflow
2. **FR-003: Therapy Planning** - Missing IEP integration workflow
3. **FR-004: Data Collection** - No progress tracking workflow
4. **FR-006: AI Content Generation** - Missing generation approval workflow
5. **FR-008: Marketplace** - No complete buyer/seller workflows
6. **FR-009: Interactive Digital Activities** - Missing student interaction flow
7. **FR-011: Seller Tools** - No seller analytics workflow
8. **FR-014: Communication Tools** - Missing parent communication flow
9. **FR-017: Movement & Sensory** - No sensory diet planning workflow
10. **FR-021: Free Resources** - Missing freemium conversion workflow
11. **FR-023: Specialized Content** - No specialized protocol workflows
12. **FR-025: Caseload Integration** - Missing unified management workflow

### Medium Priority Missing Workflows:
- FR-005, FR-010, FR-016, FR-018, FR-024, FR-026, FR-027, FR-031, FR-037, FR-038, FR-041, FR-042

### Low Priority Missing Workflows:
- FR-020, FR-022, FR-029, FR-030, FR-039, FR-040

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required (Sprint 1-2):**
   - Create comprehensive workflows for FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-006, FR-008
   - These are core platform features essential for MVP

2. **Next Priority (Sprint 3-4):**
   - Implement workflows for FR-009, FR-011, FR-014, FR-017, FR-021
   - These enhance user experience and marketplace functionality

3. **Phase 2 Implementation:**
   - Complete remaining HIGH priority workflows
   - Focus on specialized therapy protocols and integrations

4. **Technical Debt:**
   - Many features have API endpoints but lack end-to-end business workflows
   - This creates a disconnect between technical implementation and user experience

## Conclusion
With only 33.3% coverage of comprehensive business workflows, there is significant work needed to ensure the platform delivers complete user experiences beyond just API functionality. The missing workflows represent critical user journeys that must be implemented for the platform to be successful.
