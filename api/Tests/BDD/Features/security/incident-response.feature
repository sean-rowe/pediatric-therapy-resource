Feature: Security Incident Response and Breach Management
  As a security administrator
  I want comprehensive incident response capabilities
  So that security breaches are detected, contained, and properly managed

  Background:
    Given the incident response system is active
    And security monitoring is enabled
    And response procedures are configured

  # Incident Detection and Classification
  @security @incident @detection @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and classify security incidents automatically
    Given automated security monitoring is active
    When potential security incidents are detected:
      | Incident Type           | Indicators                           | Severity | Auto-Response        |
      | Brute force attack      | 50+ failed logins in 5 minutes     | High     | Block source IP      |
      | Data exfiltration       | Unusual bulk download patterns      | Critical | Block user account   |
      | Privilege escalation    | Multiple admin endpoint attempts    | High     | Lock account         |

    And security team should be alerted within 1 minute
    And incident should be logged with complete forensic data

  @security @incident @anomaly-detection @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect behavioral anomalies and suspicious patterns
