Feature: Data Encryption and Cryptographic Security
  As a security administrator
  I want comprehensive data encryption at rest and in transit
  So that sensitive therapy and student data is protected from unauthorized access

  Background:
    Given the encryption system is active
    And cryptographic standards are enforced
    And key management is properly configured

  # Encryption at Rest
  @security @encryption @data-at-rest @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
    Given the following data types require encryption at rest:
      | Data Type              | Encryption Standard | Key Rotation | Compliance Requirement |
      | Student Names          | AES-256-GCM        | 90 days      | FERPA                 |
      | Therapy Notes          | AES-256-GCM        | 90 days      | HIPAA                 |
      | Assessment Scores      | AES-256-GCM        | 90 days      | FERPA/HIPAA           |
      | Payment Information    | AES-256-GCM        | 30 days      | PCI DSS               |
      | Session Videos         | AES-256-GCM        | 90 days      | HIPAA                 |
      | IEP Documents          | AES-256-GCM        | 90 days      | FERPA                 |
    When I verify database encryption status
    Then all sensitive data should be encrypted with AES-256-GCM
    And encryption keys should be stored in secure key vault
    And data should be unreadable without proper decryption keys
    And key rotation schedule should be actively maintained

  @security @encryption @database-tde @not-implemented
  Scenario: Verify transparent database encryption (TDE)
    Given database contains encrypted student records
    When I query the database directly at storage level
    Then raw data files should be encrypted
    And database logs should be encrypted
    And backup files should be encrypted
    And temporary files should be encrypted
    When application queries database with proper credentials
    Then data should be automatically decrypted for authorized access

    And searchable fields should use deterministic encryption
    And narrative fields should use randomized encryption

    And encryption key should be separate from file storage
    And file metadata should be encrypted
    And access logs should track all file operations
    When authorized user downloads video
    Then file should be decrypted only during download
    And temporary decrypted files should be securely wiped

  @security @encryption @data-in-transit @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce TLS 1.3 for all API communications
    Given API endpoints handle sensitive data
    When client connects to API server
    Then connection should enforce TLS 1.3 minimum
    And deprecated protocols (TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2) should be rejected
    And cipher suites should be restricted to secure algorithms:
      | Cipher Suite                    | Status   | Security Level |
