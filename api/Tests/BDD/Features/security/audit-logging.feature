Feature: Comprehensive Audit Logging and Trail Management
  As a compliance administrator
  I want complete audit trail capabilities
  So that all system activities are logged for security and regulatory compliance

  Background:
    Given the audit logging system is active
    And audit policies are configured
    And log retention is properly managed

  # Comprehensive Activity Logging
  @security @audit @logging @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Log all security-relevant activities comprehensively
    Given system audit trail is enabled
    When security-relevant activities occur:
      | Activity Type              | Details                              | Required Fields                    | Retention Period |
      | User authentication        | Login attempts, MFA usage           | User ID, IP, timestamp, result     | 7 years         |
      | Authorization decisions    | Access grants/denials                | User, resource, decision, reason   | 7 years         |
      | Data access                | Student/patient record views        | User, record ID, fields accessed   | 7 years         |
      | Data modifications         | Create, update, delete operations    | User, before/after values          | 7 years         |
      | Administrative actions     | User creation, role changes          | Admin user, target, changes made   | 7 years         |
      | System configuration       | Settings changes, policy updates     | Admin, setting, old/new values     | 7 years         |
      | File operations            | Upload, download, deletion           | User, file path, operation type     | 7 years         |
      | Payment transactions       | Billing, refunds, subscriptions     | User, amount, transaction details   | 10 years        |
    Then all activities should be logged immediately
    And log entries should be immutable once written
    And log integrity should be cryptographically protected
    And logs should be available for real-time monitoring

  @security @audit @data-access @not-implemented
  Scenario: Audit student data access with detailed attribution
    Given student "Emily Johnson" has therapy records
    And therapist "dr.smith@clinic.com" accesses the records
    When data access occurs
    Then audit log should capture:

  # Log Integrity and Security
  @security @audit @integrity @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Protect audit log integrity with cryptographic measures
    Given audit logs contain sensitive compliance data
    When audit entries are created
    Then log integrity protection should include:

    And integrity violations should trigger security alerts

  @security @audit @retention-management @not-implemented
  Scenario: Manage log retention according to compliance requirements
    Given different log types have different retention requirements
    When log retention policies are applied:
      | Log Type                 | Retention Period | Compliance Driver     | Archive Method     |
      | Authentication logs      | 7 years         | HIPAA/FERPA          | Encrypted archive  |

    And legal holds should prevent premature destruction

  @security @audit @real-time-monitoring @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enable real-time security monitoring from audit logs
    Given audit logs feed security monitoring systems
    When suspicious patterns are detected in logs:

  @security @audit @log-forwarding @not-implemented
  Scenario: Forward logs to external SIEM and monitoring systems
    Given logs must be integrated with enterprise security tools
    When log forwarding is configured
    Then integration should support:

  @security @audit @error @log-tampering @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and respond to audit log tampering attempts
    Given audit log integrity is paramount
    When log tampering is attempted or detected

    And forensic investigation should be initiated
    And affected logs should be restored from secure backups

  @security @audit @error @performance-impact @not-implemented
  Scenario: Manage audit logging performance impact
    Given logging should not significantly impact system performance
    When audit logging performance is monitored
    Then performance metrics should show:
      | Performance Metric       | Target Value                        | Alert Threshold       |
      | Logging latency          | <10ms for 95% of entries           | >50ms                |

    And critical events should never be sampled or dropped

  @security @audit @error @compliance-violation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle audit compliance violations
    Given audit logs are required for regulatory compliance

    And remediation plans should be implemented immediately
    And compliance teams should be notified
    And auditors should be provided with violation reports

  @security @audit @error @data-recovery @not-implemented
  Scenario: Recover audit logs from backup systems
    Given audit logs may be lost or corrupted
    When log recovery is required
    Then recovery procedures should include:

  @security @audit @error @scalability-limits @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle audit logging at enterprise scale
    Given system may generate millions of log entries daily
    When audit volume reaches scalability limits
    Then scaling solutions should include:
