Feature: Zero Trust Security Architecture and Access Patterns
  As a security architect
  I want comprehensive zero trust security implementation
  So that every access request is verified and authorized regardless of location

  Background:
    Given zero trust architecture is implemented
    And identity verification is mandatory
    And continuous authentication is active

  # Core Zero Trust Principles
  @security @zero-trust @never-trust @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement "never trust, always verify" for all access requests
    Given zero trust principles are enforced
    When access requests are made from various contexts:
      | Access Context           | User Type        | Location        | Device Type    | Verification Required |
      | Internal network         | Employee         | Office          | Company laptop | Full verification     |
      | External network         | Employee         | Home office     | Personal device| Enhanced verification |
      | VPN connection           | Contractor       | Remote location | Managed device | Multi-factor auth     |
      | Mobile application       | Therapist        | Client site     | Mobile phone   | Biometric + PIN       |
      | API access               | Service account  | Cloud provider  | Server         | Certificate + token   |
      | Administrative access    | System admin     | Anywhere        | Any device     | Privileged access control|
    Then every access attempt should be verified independently
    And no implicit trust should be granted based on network location
    And identity should be continuously validated throughout sessions
    And access should be granted based on risk assessment

  @security @zero-trust @least-privilege @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce least privilege access with dynamic permissions
    Given least privilege access is implemented
    When users request access to resources:
      | User Role               | Requested Resource           | Default Access    | Additional Access Conditions |
      | Basic Therapist         | Own student records         | Read/Write        | None                        |
      | Basic Therapist         | Other student records       | None              | Explicit delegation only     |
      | Senior Therapist        | Department resources        | Read              | Write access on request     |
      | Clinical Supervisor     | All department data         | Read              | Write with justification    |
      | System Administrator    | System configurations       | None              | Time-limited, approved access|
      | Guest User              | Public resources            | Read-only         | No expansion possible       |
    Then access should be limited to minimum required permissions
    And permissions should be time-bounded where appropriate
    And access elevation should require explicit approval
    And unused permissions should be automatically revoked

  @security @zero-trust @microsegmentation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement network microsegmentation with policy enforcement
    Given network microsegmentation is deployed
    When network traffic flows between system components:
      | Source Component        | Destination Component        | Traffic Type      | Policy Enforcement   |
      | Web frontend            | Application API             | HTTPS             | Allow with inspection|
      | Application API         | Database cluster            | TLS               | Allow specific queries|
      | User devices            | File storage                | HTTPS             | Authenticated users only|
      | External integrations   | Internal APIs               | HTTPS             | Whitelist with rate limiting|
      | Admin tools             | System infrastructure       | SSH/HTTPS         | Privileged access only|
      | Monitoring systems      | All components              | Various           | Read-only access    |
    Then network traffic should be filtered and inspected
    And unauthorized communications should be blocked
    And traffic patterns should be continuously monitored
    And policy violations should trigger immediate alerts

  @security @zero-trust @device-verification @not-implemented
  Scenario: Verify and secure all devices accessing the platform
    Given device verification is mandatory
    When devices attempt to access system resources:
      | Device Type             | Verification Requirements        | Security Controls            |
      | Company-managed laptop  | Certificate-based auth          | Endpoint detection, encryption|
      | Personal mobile phone   | Mobile device management        | App wrapping, remote wipe    |
      | Bring-your-own-device   | Enhanced security validation   | Isolated access, limited permissions|
      | IoT/smart devices       | Device identity certificates    | Network isolation, monitoring|
      | Legacy systems          | Compensating controls           | Additional network security  |
      | Unknown devices         | Full security assessment        | Quarantine until verified   |
    Then device identity should be cryptographically verified
    And device health should be continuously monitored
    And compromised devices should be automatically isolated
    And device access should be dynamically adjusted based on risk

  @security @zero-trust @continuous-monitoring @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement continuous security monitoring and risk assessment
    Given continuous monitoring is active across all access points
    When user and system activities are monitored:
      | Monitoring Dimension    | Metrics Tracked                  | Risk Indicators              |
      | User behavior           | Login patterns, access patterns  | Unusual times, locations     |
      | Device characteristics  | Hardware fingerprints, OS version| Jailbroken, compromised      |
      | Network traffic         | Data flows, communication patterns| Unusual destinations, volumes|
      | Application usage       | Feature usage, data access       | Bulk downloads, admin functions|
      | Geographic patterns     | IP geolocation, travel patterns  | Impossible travel, VPN usage|
      | Threat intelligence     | IOCs, malware signatures         | Known bad actors, patterns  |
    Then risk scores should be calculated in real-time
    And access should be dynamically adjusted based on risk
    And anomalies should trigger additional verification
    And high-risk activities should be blocked pending investigation

  @security @zero-trust @identity-verification @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement comprehensive identity verification and management
    Given strong identity verification is required
    When identity verification is performed:
      | Identity Verification Level | Requirements                     | Use Cases                   |
      | Basic identity             | Username/password + MFA          | Standard user access        |
      | Enhanced identity          | Biometric + device verification  | Sensitive data access       |
      | Privileged identity        | Hardware token + admin approval  | Administrative functions    |
      | Service identity           | Certificate-based authentication | API and system access       |
      | Federated identity         | Trusted identity provider       | SSO from partner organizations|
    Then identity should be verified at multiple levels
    And identity proofing should be appropriate for access level
    And identity lifecycle should be managed centrally
    And identity compromise should trigger immediate remediation

  # Application-Level Zero Trust
  @security @zero-trust @application-security @not-implemented
  Scenario: Apply zero trust principles to application layer security
    Given application-level zero trust is implemented
    When applications process user requests:
      | Application Component   | Zero Trust Implementation        | Security Validation          |
      | API gateway             | Request validation, rate limiting| Authentication, authorization|
      | Microservices           | Service-to-service authentication| Mutual TLS, service mesh    |
      | Database access         | Connection encryption, audit     | Query validation, monitoring |
      | File storage            | Encryption, access logging       | Content scanning, DLP       |
      | Session management      | Continuous validation           | Session anomaly detection   |
      | Data processing         | Runtime security monitoring     | Behavior analysis           |
    Then every application interaction should be secured
    And inter-service communication should be authenticated
    And data should be protected at all processing stages
    And application behavior should be continuously monitored

  @security @zero-trust @data-protection @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement data-centric zero trust security
    Given data-centric security is implemented
    When data is accessed or processed:
      | Data Classification     | Protection Requirements          | Access Controls             |
      | Public information      | Integrity protection            | Public read access          |
      | Internal documents      | Encryption, access logging      | Employee access only        |
      | Personal data (PII)     | Encryption, anonymization       | Need-to-know basis         |
      | Health information (PHI)| Strong encryption, audit trails | Healthcare professionals only|
      | Financial data          | PCI DSS compliance              | Authorized processors only  |
      | System credentials      | Hardware security modules       | Automated systems only      |
    Then data should be classified and protected accordingly
    And data access should be logged and monitored
    And data should remain encrypted in processing where possible
    And data leakage prevention should be active

  @security @zero-trust @workload-security @not-implemented
  Scenario: Secure all workloads with zero trust principles
    Given workload security follows zero trust model
    When workloads execute in the environment:
      | Workload Type           | Security Implementation          | Isolation Requirements      |
      | Web applications        | Container security, runtime protection| Network isolation     |
      | Database systems        | Encryption, access control       | Data isolation             |
      | Background services     | Least privilege execution       | Process isolation          |
      | ML/AI processing        | Secure enclaves, data privacy   | Compute isolation          |
      | Batch processing        | Secure execution environments   | Resource isolation         |
      | Third-party integrations| Sandboxed execution             | Complete isolation         |
    Then workloads should operate with minimal privileges
    And workload communications should be secured
    And workload behavior should be monitored
    And workload isolation should prevent lateral movement

  # Zero Trust for Remote Access
  @security @zero-trust @remote-access @not-implemented
  Scenario: Secure remote access with zero trust principles
    Given remote access follows zero trust architecture
    When remote users access the platform:
      | Remote Access Scenario  | Security Requirements            | Verification Steps          |
      | Home office access      | Secure VPN, device verification | MFA + device cert          |
      | Public WiFi access      | Enhanced security validation   | Continuous auth + behavior monitoring|
      | International travel    | Geographic risk assessment     | Additional verification required|
      | Shared device access    | Restricted permissions         | Session-based access only   |
      | Emergency access        | Temporary elevated privileges  | Manager approval + logging  |
      | Contractor access       | Limited scope, time-bounded    | Sponsor approval + monitoring|
    Then remote access should never be implicitly trusted
    And access should be dynamically adjusted based on context
    And remote sessions should be continuously monitored
    And suspicious remote activity should trigger immediate response

  @security @zero-trust @cloud-workloads @not-implemented
  Scenario: Apply zero trust to cloud infrastructure and workloads
    Given cloud infrastructure follows zero trust principles
    When cloud resources are accessed or managed:
      | Cloud Component         | Zero Trust Implementation        | Security Controls           |
      | Virtual machines        | Instance identity, encryption   | Identity-based access       |
      | Container clusters      | Pod security, service mesh      | Workload identity           |
      | Serverless functions    | Function-level authentication   | Execution isolation         |

      | Cloud databases         | Connection encryption, auditing | Database identity           |
      | Cloud APIs              | API authentication, rate limiting| Token-based access        |
    Then cloud resources should not trust network location
    And cloud workload identity should be cryptographically verified
    And cloud communications should be encrypted and authenticated
    And cloud access should be continuously validated

  # Error Condition Scenarios
  @security @zero-trust @error @identity-service-failure @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle identity service failures gracefully
    Given identity services may experience outages
    When identity verification services fail:
      | Failure Type            | Fallback Strategy               | Security Posture            |
      | Primary IdP unavailable | Secondary identity provider     | Maintain strong authentication|
      | MFA service outage      | Alternative authentication factors| No relaxation of requirements|
      | Certificate authority down| Cached certificate validation   | Limited time validation     |
      | Network connectivity loss| Local identity cache           | Reduced session duration    |
    Then system should fail securely
    And access should be denied rather than granted when uncertain
    And fallback mechanisms should maintain security posture
    And service restoration should be prioritized

  @security @zero-trust @error @policy-conflicts @not-implemented
  Scenario: Resolve conflicts between zero trust policies
    Given multiple security policies may conflict
    When policy conflicts arise:
      | Conflict Type           | Resolution Strategy             | Priority Order              |
      | Access vs. security     | Security takes precedence       | Security first             |
      | Performance vs. verification| Security over performance    | Never compromise security   |
      | Usability vs. controls | Secure usability design        | Security-first UX          |
      | Legacy vs. zero trust   | Compensating controls           | Gradual migration          |
    Then security policies should be prioritized
    And conflicts should be resolved in favor of stronger security
    And policy conflicts should be documented and reviewed
    And policy updates should be tested before deployment

  @security @zero-trust @error @network-segmentation-bypass @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and prevent network segmentation bypasses
    Given network microsegmentation policies are enforced
    When attempts are made to bypass network controls:
      | Bypass Attempt Type     | Detection Method                | Response Action             |
      | Protocol tunneling      | Deep packet inspection          | Block tunnel, alert SOC    |
      | Network policy violation| Real-time traffic analysis      | Immediate connection termination|
      | Lateral movement        | Behavior analysis               | Isolate source system       |
      | Privilege escalation    | Access pattern monitoring       | Revoke elevated permissions |
    Then bypass attempts should be immediately detected
    And automatic containment should be triggered
    And incidents should be logged for investigation
    And policy enforcement should be strengthened

  @security @zero-trust @error @continuous-monitoring-gaps @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle gaps in continuous monitoring coverage
    Given continuous monitoring should have complete coverage
    When monitoring gaps are detected:
      | Gap Type                | Impact Assessment               | Mitigation Strategy         |
      | Network blind spots     | Unmonitored traffic flows      | Deploy additional sensors   |
      | Application monitoring gaps| Unlogged user activities      | Enhance application logging |
      | Device visibility gaps  | Unknown devices on network     | Improve device discovery    |
      | Identity monitoring gaps| Untracked identity usage       | Enhance identity correlation|
    Then monitoring gaps should be immediately addressed
    And compensating controls should be implemented
    And monitoring coverage should be regularly assessed
    And gaps should be prioritized based on risk

  @security @zero-trust @error @performance-degradation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Maintain zero trust security during performance issues
    Given zero trust implementation may impact performance
    When system performance degrades:
      | Performance Issue       | Security Response               | Acceptable Trade-offs       |
      | Network latency increase| Maintain encryption, reduce timeouts| Slightly slower response  |
      | Authentication delays   | Keep authentication requirements| Longer login times         |
      | Monitoring overhead     | Continue security monitoring    | Some performance impact    |
      | Policy enforcement lag  | Maintain security policies     | Delayed but secure access  |
    Then security should not be compromised for performance
    And performance optimization should not weaken security
    And performance issues should be addressed through scaling
    And security monitoring should identify performance-related attacks

  @security @zero-trust @error @legacy-system-integration @not-implemented
  Scenario: Integrate legacy systems that cannot fully support zero trust
    Given some legacy systems cannot be immediately upgraded
    When integrating legacy systems with zero trust architecture:
      | Legacy System Type      | Limitation                      | Compensating Controls       |
      | Old authentication systems| No modern auth protocols      | Network isolation, monitoring|
      | Legacy applications     | No encryption support          | TLS termination, proxy      |
      | Embedded systems        | Limited security features      | Network segmentation        |
      | Third-party systems     | Cannot modify security         | Enhanced perimeter security |
    Then compensating controls should maintain security posture
    And legacy systems should be isolated and monitored
    And migration plans should be developed for legacy systems
    And risk should be continuously assessed and managed
