Feature: Role-Based Access Control and Authorization
  As a security administrator
  I want comprehensive role-based access controls
  So that users only access resources appropriate to their role

  Background:
    Given the authorization system is active
    And role-based access control is configured
    And user permissions are properly defined

  # Role Definition and Management
  @security @rbac @roles @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Define and validate therapy professional roles
    Given the following roles are defined in the system:
      | Role                    | Permissions                                           | Resource Access              |
      | Basic Therapist         | read-resources, create-sessions, manage-own-students | Own caseload only           |
      | Senior Therapist        | basic + create-resources, mentor-students            | Own + supervised caseloads  |
      | Lead Therapist          | senior + approve-resources, manage-team              | Department caseloads        |
      | Clinical Supervisor     | lead + access-all-data, generate-reports            | All department data         |
      | District Administrator  | supervisor + manage-licenses, configure-settings    | District-wide access        |
      | System Administrator    | all-permissions                                      | Full system access          |
    When I verify role permissions
    Then each role should have clearly defined boundaries
    And no role should have excessive permissions
    And permission inheritance should follow proper hierarchy

  @security @rbac @role-assignment @not-implemented
  Scenario: Assign and validate user roles with approval workflow
    Given I am a district administrator
    And user "new.therapist@school.edu" needs role assignment
    When I assign role "Senior Therapist" to the user
    Then assignment should require approval from:
      | Approver Role           | Required | Reason                    |
      | Clinical Supervisor     | Yes      | Validates clinical competence |
      | District Administrator  | Yes      | Confirms organizational need  |
    And user should receive notification of pending assignment
    And temporary limited access should be granted
    When all approvals are received
    Then full role permissions should be activated
    And audit log should record the assignment

  @security @rbac @permission-boundaries @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce strict permission boundaries for student data
    Given I am a "Basic Therapist" with student caseload:

      | STU-002   | Yes      | Full        |
      | STU-003   | No       | None        |
    When I attempt to access student "STU-001" data
    Then access should be granted immediately
    And all actions should be logged
    When I attempt to access student "STU-003" data  
    Then access should be denied
    And security violation should be logged
    And I should see error "Access denied: Student not in your caseload"

  @security @rbac @resource-permissions @not-implemented
  Scenario: Control resource access based on subscription and role

    When I attempt to download premium worksheet "WS-001"
    Then download should be allowed
    When I attempt to access assessment tool "ASSESS-001"
    Then access should be denied
    And upgrade recommendation should be provided

  @security @rbac @temporal-permissions @not-implemented
  Scenario: Manage time-based and conditional permissions
    Given I am a "Clinical Supervisor" 
    And I have "Emergency Access" privileges during:

      | System maintenance     | Full        | Override    |
    When I access the system at 7:30 PM on Tuesday
    Then I should have read-only access
    And session should have "Emergency Access" flag
    And supervisor should be notified of after-hours access
    When I attempt to modify student records
    Then modification should be blocked
    And I should see "Emergency access - modifications not permitted"

  @security @rbac @data-segregation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce data segregation by organization and district
    Given multiple organizations use the platform:
      | Organization     | District | Users | Data Isolation |

      | Pine Valley ISD  | PVISD    | 18    | Strict         |
      | Metro Therapy    | Private  | 12    | Strict         |
    When I am logged in as "therapist@riverside.edu"
    And I search for students
    Then results should only include Riverside School students
    And no cross-organization data should be visible
    When I attempt to access Pine Valley student data directly
    Then access should be blocked at database level
    And security incident should be flagged

      | /api/admin/audit-logs      | GET    | 403 Forbidden   |
      | /api/admin/role-management | POST   | 403 Forbidden   |
    Then all attempts should be blocked
    And security alerts should be generated
    And my account should be flagged for review
    When multiple escalation attempts occur (5+ in 1 hour)
    Then my account should be temporarily locked
    And security team should be notified immediately

  @security @rbac @session-permissions @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate session-based permission changes
    Given I am logged in as "Senior Therapist"
    And my role permissions are cached in session
    When administrator changes my role to "Basic Therapist"
    Then my next API request should trigger permission refresh
    And reduced permissions should take effect immediately
    And sensitive actions should require re-authentication
    When I attempt to use previously available features
    Then access should be denied
    And I should receive notification of role change

  @security @rbac @resource-ownership @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce resource ownership and sharing rules
    Given I created a custom worksheet "MY-WS-001"
    And resource ownership rules define:
      | Action       | Owner | Same Department | Different Department |
      | View         | Yes   | With permission | No                  |

    Then sharing should require admin approval
    And approval workflow should be initiated

  # Advanced RBAC Scenarios
  @security @rbac @context-aware @not-implemented

      | Resource approval  | 1 week           | Emergency only          |
    Then delegation should require supervisor approval
    And delegated permissions should have clear expiration

    Given a critical student safety incident occurs
    When emergency access is triggered by "crisis.coordinator@school.edu"

      | Contact information| 4 hours  | Crisis coordinators     |
      | Medical information| 4 hours  | Authorized personnel    |
    And all emergency access should be logged
    And automatic review should be scheduled
    When emergency period expires
    Then permissions should automatically revoke
    And incident report should be required

    And permission changes should be held pending review
    And user should maintain previous permissions until resolved

  @security @rbac @error @permission-inheritance @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle broken permission inheritance chains
    Given organizational hierarchy has permission inheritance:
      | Level        | Inherits From     | Additional Permissions |

      | SSO Provider   | Allow local authentication temporarily  |
      | EHR System     | Queue updates for retry                |
      | LMS Platform   | Disable assignment features            |
    And all sync failures should be logged
    And manual override procedures should be available
    And sync restoration should be automated when possible
