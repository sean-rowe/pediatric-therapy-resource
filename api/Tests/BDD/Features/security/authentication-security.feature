Feature: Advanced Authentication Security
  As a security administrator
  I want comprehensive authentication security controls
  So that the platform maintains enterprise-grade security standards

  Background:
    Given the security system is active
    And advanced authentication features are enabled
    And security policies are configured

  # Multi-Factor Authentication
  @security @mfa @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce MFA for high-privilege accounts
    Given I am a verified therapist with admin privileges
    And MFA is required for admin accounts
    When I attempt to login with valid credentials
    Then I should be prompted for MFA verification
    And login should be blocked until MFA is provided
    When I provide valid MFA token "123456"
    Then I should be granted access with admin privileges
    And the session should include MFA verification flag

  @security @mfa @backup-codes @not-implemented
  Scenario: Use MFA backup codes for emergency access
    Given I have MFA enabled on my account
    And I have unused backup codes: ["ABC123", "DEF456", "GHI789"]
    And my primary MFA device is unavailable
    When I attempt to login with valid credentials
    And I select "Use backup code" option
    And I enter backup code "ABC123"
    Then I should be granted access
    And the backup code "ABC123" should be marked as used
    And I should be warned about remaining backup codes

  @security @mfa @brute-force @not-implemented
  Scenario: Prevent MFA brute force attacks
    Given I am attempting MFA verification
    When I enter incorrect MFA codes 5 times:
      | Attempt | Code   | Result              |
      | 1       | 111111 | Invalid, try again  |
      | 2       | 222222 | Invalid, try again  |
      | 3       | 333333 | Invalid, try again  |
      | 4       | 444444 | Invalid, try again  |
      | 5       | 555555 | Account locked      |
    Then my account should be temporarily locked
    And I should receive security alert notification
    And admin should be notified of potential attack

  # Advanced Password Security
  @security @passwords @complexity @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce advanced password complexity requirements
    Given I am creating a new account
    When I attempt to set passwords with varying complexity:
      | Password        | Length | Uppercase | Lowercase | Numbers | Symbols | Result     |
      | password123     | 11     | 0         | 8         | 3       | 0       | Rejected   |
      | Password123     | 11     | 1         | 7         | 3       | 0       | Rejected   |
      | Password123!    | 12     | 1         | 7         | 3       | 1       | Accepted   |
      | MyP@ssw0rd2024  | 14     | 2         | 6         | 4       | 2       | Accepted   |
    Then only passwords meeting all complexity requirements should be accepted
    And password strength meter should reflect actual security level

  @security @passwords @history @not-implemented
  Scenario: Prevent password reuse across multiple changes
    Given I am an authenticated user
    And my password history includes:
      | Previous Password | Date Changed |
      | OldPassword1!     | 2024-01-01   |
      | OldPassword2!     | 2024-02-01   |
      | OldPassword3!     | 2024-03-01   |
      | OldPassword4!     | 2024-04-01   |
      | OldPassword5!     | 2024-05-01   |
    When I attempt to change password to "OldPassword2!"
    Then the change should be rejected
    And I should see error "Password has been used recently"
    When I attempt to change password to "NewPassword2024!"
    Then the change should be accepted
    And the new password should be added to history

  @security @passwords @expiration @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce password expiration for sensitive accounts
    Given I am a therapist with access to PHI
    And password expiration is set to 90 days
    And my password was last changed 85 days ago
    When I login to the system
    Then I should see password expiration warning
    And warning should show "5 days remaining"
    When my password expires (91 days old)
    And I attempt to login
    Then I should be forced to change password
    And I cannot access the system until password is updated

  # Session Security
  @security @sessions @concurrent @not-implemented
  Scenario: Manage concurrent session limits
    Given I am logged in from my office computer
    And concurrent session limit is set to 3
    When I login from my home computer
    And I login from my tablet
    And I login from my phone
    Then all 3 sessions should remain active
    When I attempt to login from a 4th device
    Then I should be prompted to terminate existing session
    And I should see list of active sessions with device info
    When I select to terminate "Office Computer" session
    Then the new session should be created
    And the office session should be immediately terminated

  @security @sessions @suspicious-activity @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and respond to suspicious session activity
    Given I am logged in from "New York, USA"
    When a login attempt occurs from "Moscow, Russia" within 30 minutes
    Then the system should flag suspicious activity
    And all active sessions should be terminated
    And I should receive immediate security alert
    And the new login should be blocked pending verification
    When I verify "This was not me" 
    Then account should be locked for investigation
    And password reset should be required

  @security @sessions @idle-timeout @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce session idle timeout based on sensitivity level
    Given I am accessing patient health information (PHI)
    And idle timeout for PHI access is set to 15 minutes
    When I remain inactive for 10 minutes
    Then I should receive inactivity warning
    When I remain inactive for 15 minutes total
    Then my session should be automatically terminated
    And I should be redirected to secure login page
    And session data should be securely cleared

  # Account Security
  @security @accounts @lockout @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement progressive account lockout
    Given account lockout is configured with progressive delays
    When I make failed login attempts:
      | Attempt | Delay After Failure | Status           |
      | 1       | 0 seconds          | Try again        |
      | 2       | 0 seconds          | Try again        |
      | 3       | 30 seconds         | Brief lockout    |
      | 4       | 60 seconds         | Extended lockout |
      | 5       | 300 seconds        | Long lockout     |
    Then lockout duration should increase progressively
    And security team should be notified after 3rd attempt
    And source IP should be monitored for patterns

  @security @accounts @compromise-detection @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and respond to account compromise indicators
    Given I have normal usage patterns established
    When suspicious activities are detected:
      | Activity Type           | Indicator                    | Risk Level |
      | Mass file downloads     | 500+ resources in 1 hour    | High       |
      | Unusual access pattern  | 3 AM login (normally 9-5)   | Medium     |
      | New device login        | Unrecognized browser/OS      | Medium     |
      | Geographic anomaly      | Login from different country | High       |
      | Password change         | No recent activity trigger   | Medium     |
    Then risk score should be calculated
    And appropriate security measures should be triggered:
      | Risk Level | Response                           |
      | Low        | Log event for monitoring           |
      | Medium     | Require additional verification    |
      | High       | Lock account, alert security team  |

  # Device Security
  @security @devices @registration @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement trusted device registration
    Given I am logging in from a new device
    When I complete initial authentication
    Then I should be prompted to register device as trusted
    When I choose to register device
    Then device fingerprint should be captured
    And I should receive email confirmation with device details
    When I login from same device in future
    Then MFA requirement should be reduced
    And device should be recognized as trusted

  @security @devices @compromised @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle compromised device scenarios
    Given I have 3 trusted devices registered
    When I report device "iPhone 12" as stolen
    Then that device should be immediately removed from trusted list
    And all active sessions from that device should be terminated
    And any API tokens for that device should be revoked
    And security alert should be sent to my email
    When stolen device attempts to access account
    Then access should be denied
    And security incident should be logged

  # Error Condition Scenarios
  @security @error @service-outage @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle authentication service outages gracefully
    Given authentication service becomes unavailable
    When users attempt to login
    Then graceful degradation should occur:
      | Fallback Level | Available Functions              |
      | Level 1        | Cached authentication only       |
      | Level 2        | Read-only access to resources    |
      | Level 3        | Emergency access for critical users |
    And users should be notified of service status
    And system should queue authentication requests

  @security @error @database-failure @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle authentication database failures
    Given user authentication database is corrupted
    When authentication requests are made
    Then system should:
      | Response                    | Implementation                |
      | Fail securely               | Deny access rather than allow |
      | Activate backup systems     | Secondary auth database       |
      | Alert administrators        | Immediate notification        |
      | Log all attempts            | Forensic analysis capability  |
    And no user data should be exposed

  @security @error @token-corruption @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle corrupted authentication tokens
    Given user has valid session with corrupted JWT token
    When token corruption is detected
    Then user should be immediately logged out
    And new authentication should be required
    And incident should be logged for investigation
    And user should receive security notification

  @security @error @timing-attacks @not-implemented
  Scenario: Prevent timing-based authentication attacks
    Given authentication system implements timing attack protection
    When login attempts are made with:
      | Username Type    | Password Type | Expected Response Time |
      | Valid user      | Wrong password | 500ms ± 50ms          |
      | Invalid user    | Any password   | 500ms ± 50ms          |
      | Valid user      | Correct password| 500ms ± 50ms         |
    Then response times should be consistent
    And timing differences should not reveal user existence
    And rate limiting should prevent rapid attempts
