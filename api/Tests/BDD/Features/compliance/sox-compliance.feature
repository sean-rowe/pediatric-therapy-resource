Feature: SOX Compliance and Financial Controls for Marketplace
  As a platform with financial marketplace operations
  I want to ensure SOX compliance for financial controls
  So that financial reporting is accurate and fraud is prevented

  Background:
    Given SOX compliance systems are operational
    And financial controls are implemented
    And marketplace transaction systems are active
    And audit trails are configured
    And internal control frameworks are established
