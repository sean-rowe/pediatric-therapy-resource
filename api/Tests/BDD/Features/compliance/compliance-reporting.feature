Feature: Compliance and Reporting
  As a therapy practice administrator
  I want to ensure regulatory compliance and generate required reports
  So that we meet all legal requirements and maintain accreditation

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as administrator
    And the following compliance frameworks apply:
      | Framework | Requirement                               |
      | HIPAA     | Protected health information security    |
      | FERPA     | Educational records privacy              |
      | Medicaid  | Documentation and billing compliance     |
      | State     | Therapy licensure and supervision rules  |

  Rule: System must enforce documentation compliance

    @not-implemented
    Scenario: Monitor documentation timeliness
      Given documentation must be completed within 48 hours
      When I view compliance dashboard
      Then I see:
        | Metric                    | Count | Status    |
        | Sessions documented <24hr | 145   | Compliant |
        | Sessions documented 24-48hr | 23  | Compliant |
        | Sessions pending >48hr    | 3     | Alert     |
        | Sessions missing documentation | 0 | Good     |
      And non-compliant items show:
        | Therapist      | Student      | Session Date | Hours Overdue |
        | Sarah Johnson  | Emma Wilson  | 2024-01-13  | 12           |
      And automated reminders were sent

    @not-implemented
    Scenario: Track signature requirements
      Given supervisory signatures required monthly
      When I check signature compliance
      Then report shows:
        | Therapist         | Documents | Signed | Pending | Due Date   |
        | Sarah Johnson     | 47        | 45     | 2       | 2024-01-31 |
        | Michael Chen      | 52        | 52     | 0       | Compliant  |
        | Amy Lee (CF)      | 38        | 38     | 0       | Compliant  |
      And pending items are flagged for supervisor

    @not-implemented
    Scenario: Verify credential compliance
      Given therapists must maintain current licenses
      When I run credential audit
      Then system reports:
        | Therapist      | License    | Expiration  | Status           |
        | Sarah Johnson  | OT-12345  | 2024-12-31  | Active          |
        | Michael Chen   | PT-67890  | 2024-03-15  | Expiring Soon   |
        | Amy Lee        | SLP-54321 | 2024-08-30  | Active          |
      And expiring credentials trigger:
        | Days Before | Action                          |
        | 90         | Email reminder to therapist     |
        | 60         | Email reminder + supervisor     |
        | 30         | Daily reminders + practice admin |
