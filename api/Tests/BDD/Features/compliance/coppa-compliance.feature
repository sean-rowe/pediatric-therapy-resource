Feature: COPPA Compliance and Child Data Protection
  As a platform serving children under 13
  I want to ensure full COPPA compliance
  So that children's online privacy is protected according to federal requirements

  Background:
    Given COPPA compliance systems are operational
    And age verification mechanisms are implemented
    And parental consent systems are configured
    And data collection limitations are enforced
    And child-safe environments are maintained

  # Core COPPA Requirements
  @compliance @coppa @age-verification @child-protection @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement comprehensive age verification and child protection
    Given COPPA applies to children under 13
    And age verification must be reliable
    When implementing age verification:
      | Verification Method | Implementation Approach | Reliability Level | Parent Verification | Fallback Process | Documentation |
      | Date of birth entry | Required at registration | Self-declaration | Parent confirmation required | Manual verification | Age declaration records |

      | Third-party verification | Age verification service | Service-verified | Parent validation | Manual review | Verification audit |
    Then age verification should be implemented
    And methods should be reliable
    And parent involvement should be required
    And documentation should be maintained

  @compliance @coppa @parental-consent @verifiable-consent @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Obtain verifiable parental consent for data collection
