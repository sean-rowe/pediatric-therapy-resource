Feature: PCI DSS Compliance and Payment Card Security
  As a platform processing payment card transactions
  I want to ensure full PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
  So that cardholder data is protected according to industry standards

  Background:
    Given PCI DSS compliance systems are operational
    And cardholder data environment (CDE) is defined
    And network segmentation is implemented
    And encryption mechanisms are active
    And security controls are configured

  # Core PCI DSS Requirements
