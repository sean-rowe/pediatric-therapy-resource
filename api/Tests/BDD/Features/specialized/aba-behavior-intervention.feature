  As an ABA practitioner or BCBA
  I want comprehensive behavior intervention planning support
  So that I can develop and implement effective function-based interventions

  Background:
    Given ABA behavior intervention system is configured
    And intervention protocols are evidence-based
    And function-based approaches are prioritized
    And implementation fidelity is monitored
    And data collection is integrated

  # Core Behavior Intervention Planning
  @specialized @aba @behavior-intervention @bip-development @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Develop comprehensive behavior intervention plans
    Given functional analysis has identified behavior functions
    And intervention planning is required
    When developing behavior intervention plans:
      | Target Behavior | Identified Function | Replacement Behavior | Antecedent Strategies | Consequence Strategies | Environmental Modifications | Implementation Team | Success Criteria |
      | Aggression | Attention-seeking | Appropriate attention requests | Scheduled attention | Differential attention | Clear expectations posted | Teacher, aide, parents | 80% reduction in 4 weeks |
      | Self-injury | Escape from demands | Break requests | Task modification | Break contingent on request | Sensory tools available | BCBA, therapist, family | 90% reduction in 6 weeks |
      | Tantrums | Tangible access | Appropriate item requests | Choice boards | Item access for requests | Preferred items visible | All staff | 75% reduction in 3 weeks |
      | Elopement | Sensory seeking | Sensory breaks | Movement breaks | Sensory activities | Safe movement options | Security, all staff | 95% reduction in 2 weeks |
      | Disruption | Multiple functions | Multiple replacements | Comprehensive approach | Multi-component plan | Complete environment | Entire team | 70% reduction in 8 weeks |
      | Property destruction | Frustration/escape | Help requests | Task analysis | Assistance provision | Task difficulty adjustment | Teacher, aide | 85% reduction in 5 weeks |
    Then behavior intervention plans should be comprehensive
    And interventions should match identified functions
    And replacement behaviors should be functionally equivalent
    And implementation should be team-based

  @specialized @aba @behavior-intervention @multi-component @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement multi-component behavior intervention strategies
    Given complex behaviors require comprehensive interventions
    And single strategies may be insufficient
    When implementing multi-component interventions:
      | Component Type | Specific Strategy | Implementation Method | Target Outcome | Monitoring Method | Success Indicators |
      | Antecedent | Environmental restructuring | Visual schedules, clear expectations | Prevent behavior occurrence | Daily environment checks | 50% reduction in triggers |
      | Teaching | Communication training | FCT, social skills | Replacement skill acquisition | Skill probe data | 80% use of replacement |

      | Generalization | Cross-setting training | Multiple environments, people | Skill transfer | Multi-setting data | 60% cross-setting success |

    And implementation should be systematic
    And outcomes should be comprehensive

  @specialized @aba @behavior-intervention @replacement-behaviors @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Teach functionally equivalent replacement behaviors

      | Hitting for attention | Attention | Raising hand | Direct instruction | Most-to-least prompting | FR1 to VR3 | Multiple people/settings | 90% independent use |
      | Screaming to escape | Escape | "Break please" | Incidental teaching | Time delay | Immediate to delayed | All demand contexts | 80% spontaneous use |
      | Grabbing items | Tangible | "Can I have ___?" | Natural environment | Least-to-most prompting | Continuous to intermittent | All preferred items | 85% appropriate requests |
      | Rocking for sensory | Sensory | Fidget toy use | Modeling and practice | Physical guidance to gesture | Fixed interval to variable | Multiple sensory needs | 75% independent selection |
      | Yelling for help | Attention/help | Tapping shoulder | Social skills training | Graduated guidance | FR1 to FR5 | Multiple help situations | 90% appropriate help-seeking |
      | Running away | Escape/sensory | "I need space" | Video modeling | Verbal to gesture prompt | Immediate to 30-second delay | Multiple overwhelming situations | 70% independent use |
