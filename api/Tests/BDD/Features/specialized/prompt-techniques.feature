Feature: PROMPT Technique Implementation and Support
  As a speech-language pathologist implementing PROMPT
  I want comprehensive PROMPT technique support
  So that I can effectively implement tactile-kinesthetic-proprioceptive cueing for speech development

  Background:
    Given PROMPT technique system is configured
    And PROMPT protocols are evidence-based
    And tactile cueing systems are established
    And motor speech assessments are integrated
    And training requirements are validated

  # Core PROMPT Implementation
  @specialized @prompt @technique-implementation @tactile-cueing @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement comprehensive PROMPT tactile cueing systems
    Given PROMPT uses specific tactile cues for speech sounds
    And precise cueing is essential for motor learning
    When implementing PROMPT tactile cueing:
      | Sound Target | Cue Location | Cue Type | Pressure Level | Movement Pattern | Learning Objective |
      | /p/ bilabial | Lips and jaw | Static pressure | Light-moderate | Lip closure | Bilabial coordination |
      | /t/ alveolar | Tongue tip and alveolar ridge | Dynamic movement | Moderate | Tongue elevation | Tongue tip precision |
