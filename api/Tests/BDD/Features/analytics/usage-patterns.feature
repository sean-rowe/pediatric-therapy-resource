      | Session recording    | Yes          | Not permitted         | N/A              | N/A           | Blocked          |
      | Behavioral tracking  | Indirect     | Differential privacy  | Explicit         | 6 months      | CCPA compliant   |
      | Performance metrics  | No           | None needed           | None             | Indefinite    | All compliant    |
    Then privacy requirements should be enforced
    And user consent should be verified
    And anonymization should be effective
    And compliance should be documented

  @analytics @usage-patterns @error @scale-limitations @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle analytics at extreme scale
    Given usage may exceed normal parameters
    When dealing with scale challenges:
      | Scale Scenario        | Data Volume    | Processing Time | System Impact | Mitigation Applied      | Result Status    |
      | Holiday traffic spike | 10x normal     | 5x increase    | High load     | Sampling (1:10)        | Handled well     |
      | Viral content        | 100x for item  | 20x increase   | Hotspot       | Caching + CDN          | Managed          |
      | DDoS attempt         | 1000x requests | System stress  | Critical      | Rate limiting + block  | Defended         |
      | Data export request  | 50GB          | 2 hours        | I/O heavy     | Queue + batch          | Completed        |
      | Real-time dashboard  | 10K concurrent | CPU intensive  | High          | Aggregation tiers      | Optimized        |
      | Historical analysis  | 5 year span    | 24 hours      | Memory heavy  | Distributed compute    | Successful       |
    Then scale challenges should be anticipated
    And systems should gracefully degrade
    And performance should remain acceptable
    And insights quality should be maintained

  @analytics @usage-patterns @error @insight-validation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate and verify analytical insights
    Given insights may be misleading
    When validating analytical conclusions:
      | Insight Claimed            | Statistical Test | Sample Size | P-value | Effect Size | External Validation | Final Verdict    |
      | "AI increases engagement"  | A/B test        | 10,000     | 0.001   | Large      | Industry studies   | Confirmed        |
      | "Mobile users stay longer" | T-test          | 5,000      | 0.03    | Medium     | User interviews    | Likely true      |
      | "PT resources underused"   | Chi-square      | 15,000     | 0.08    | Small      | Therapist survey   | Not significant  |
      | "Gamification helps"       | ANOVA           | 8,000      | 0.002   | Large      | Literature review  | Strongly supported|
      | "Season affects usage"     | Time series     | 3 years    | 0.001   | Large      | Historical data    | Confirmed        |
      | "Price sensitivity high"   | Regression      | 20,000     | 0.15    | Minimal    | Market research    | Not supported    |
    Then insights should be statistically validated
    And confidence levels should be reported
    And external validation should be sought
    And decisions should be evidence-based
