    When working with limited signals:
      | Data Available     | Interactions Count | Strategy Used           | Recommendation Confidence | Enhancement Method      |
      | Views only         | <10               | Content similarity      | Low (60%)                | Prompt for ratings      |
      | Downloads only     | <5                | Category expansion      | Medium (70%)             | Usage tracking added    |
      | Single session     | 1                 | Session success based   | Low (55%)                | Follow-up requested     |
      | Sporadic use       | Monthly           | Seasonal patterns       | Medium (75%)             | Engagement campaigns    |
      | Narrow focus       | One category      | Gentle expansion        | High in category (85%)   | Cross-domain suggests   |
      | Passive browsing   | No downloads      | Popular items boost     | Low (50%)                | Call-to-action added    |
    Then recommendations should still be generated
    And confidence should reflect data limitations
    And data collection should be encouraged
    And Quality should not be compromised

  Scenario: Resolve conflicting user preference signals
    Given user behavior may be inconsistent
    When handling conflicting signals:
      | Signal Type A      | Signal Type B        | Conflict Nature         | Resolution Strategy      | Final Recommendation    |
      | High ratings       | Low usage           | Aspiration vs reality   | Balance both signals     | Easier entry point      |
      | Downloads          | Poor outcomes       | Selection vs success    | Prioritize outcomes      | Better alternatives     |
      | Searches for X     | Uses Y              | Stated vs revealed      | Test both directions     | A/B recommendations     |
      | Colleague success  | Personal failure    | Individual differences  | Personalize approach     | Modified version        |
      | Past preferences   | Recent changes      | Evolution of needs      | Weight recent higher     | New direction support   |
      | Multiple goals     | Time constraints    | Competing priorities    | Efficient combinations   | Multi-purpose resources |
    Then conflicts should be intelligently resolved
    And user intent should be understood
    And Recommendations should be coherent
    And Learning should continue

  @analytics @recommendations @error @bias-mitigation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and mitigate recommendation biases
    Given recommendation systems can perpetuate biases
    When checking for bias:
      | Bias Type          | Detection Method     | Finding                | Mitigation Applied       | Result Verified         |
      | Popularity bias    | Distribution analysis| 80% from top 10%       | Diversity injection      | 60% from top 10%       |
      | Demographic bias   | Outcome comparison   | Unequal effectiveness  | Fairness constraints     | Equalized outcomes      |
      | Historical bias    | Temporal analysis    | Outdated preferences   | Recency weighting        | Modern resources rise   |
      | Creator bias       | Source distribution  | Few creators dominate  | Source diversification   | Broader creator base    |
      | Language bias      | Multilingual check   | English-heavy          | Language balancing       | Proportional represent  |
      | Complexity bias    | Difficulty analysis  | Skews too simple       | Level distribution       | Full range covered      |
    Then biases should be actively detected
    And mitigation should be systematic
    And Fairness should be monitored
    And Diversity should be promoted
