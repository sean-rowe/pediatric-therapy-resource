Feature: Therapy Outcome Forecasting and Goal Achievement Prediction
  As a therapy professional
  I want to forecast therapy outcomes and goal achievement likelihood
  So that I can set realistic expectations and optimize treatment plans

  Background:
    Given outcome prediction models are configured
    And historical outcome data is available
    And multivariate analysis is enabled
    And evidence-based benchmarks are loaded
    And stakeholder communication tools are ready

  # Core Outcome Prediction Workflows
  @analytics @outcome-prediction @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Forecast therapy outcomes for individual students
    Given I have students with established therapy plans
    And baseline assessments are complete
    When forecasting therapy outcomes:
      | Student ID | Diagnosis            | Therapy Type | Current Function | 3-Month Forecast | 6-Month Forecast | 1-Year Forecast | Confidence | Key Factors                    |
      | S001      | Articulation delay   | Speech       | 40% accuracy    | 65% accuracy    | 80% accuracy    | 92% accuracy   | 85%       | High motivation, family support |

    Then forecasts should be evidence-based
    And confidence intervals should be provided
    And key influencing factors should be identified
    And timelines should be realistic

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @goal-achievement @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Predict IEP goal achievement probability
    Given students have specific IEP goals
    And progress data is tracked regularly
    When analyzing goal achievement likelihood:

    Then achievement probabilities should guide planning
    And risk factors should be addressable
    And recommendations should be specific
    And families should understand projections

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @discharge-readiness @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Predict discharge readiness and transition timing
    Given students are making progress in therapy
    And discharge criteria are defined
    When predicting discharge readiness:
      | Student ID | Service Type | Months in Service | Current Status   | Discharge Readiness | Predicted Timeline | Transition Plan Needed | Follow-up Risk |
      | S001      | Speech      | 18               | 85% goals met    | High               | 2-3 months        | Parent training       | Low           |

    Then discharge predictions should be realistic
    And transition plans should be proactive
    And follow-up needs should be identified
    And continuity of care should be ensured

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @long-term @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Generate long-term functional outcome predictions
    Given comprehensive assessment data exists

    Then comparative predictions should be evidence-based
    And trade-offs should be clearly presented
    And family preferences should be considered
    And cost-effectiveness should be included

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @risk-stratification @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Stratify students by outcome risk levels
    Given population-level outcome data exists
    And risk factors are quantified
    When stratifying by outcome risk:

    Then risk stratification should guide resource allocation
    And high-risk students should receive priority
    And prevention strategies should be targeted
    And outcomes should be continuously monitored

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @family-factors @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Incorporate family and environmental factors in predictions
    Given family engagement impacts outcomes
    And environmental factors are assessed
    When adjusting predictions for context:
      | Base Prediction | Family Factors           | Environmental Factors    | Adjusted Prediction | Confidence Change | Support Recommendations     |

    Then family factors should significantly influence predictions
    And environmental considerations should be included
    And support recommendations should address barriers
    And family strengths should be leveraged

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @cost-effectiveness @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Predict cost-effectiveness of therapy interventions
    Given therapy resources have associated costs
    And outcome improvements can be quantified
    When analyzing cost-effectiveness:
      | Intervention Type      | Weekly Cost | Duration Estimate | Total Investment | Predicted Outcome  | Cost per % Gain | Value Rating | Insurance Coverage |
      | Standard therapy      | $200        | 26 weeks         | $5,200          | 30% improvement   | $173           | Good         | 80% covered       |

    And family budgets should be considered

  # Outcome Tracking and Validation
  @analytics @outcome-prediction @validation @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate prediction accuracy against actual outcomes
    Given predictions have been made historically
    And actual outcomes are documented

    Then prediction accuracy should be tracked
    And model improvements should be data-driven
    And Outliers should be investigated
    And Continuous improvement should occur

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @communication @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Communicate outcome predictions to stakeholders
    Given predictions must be shared sensitively
    And different stakeholders need different information
    When preparing prediction communications:
      | Stakeholder    | Prediction Type      | Communication Method | Key Messages                | Visualization    | Follow-up Plan        |
      | Parents        | Goal achievement    | In-person meeting   | Hopeful but realistic      | Progress charts  | Monthly check-ins     |
      | IEP team       | Annual progress     | Written report      | Data-driven projections    | Outcome graphs   | Quarterly reviews     |

      | Administrators | Program outcomes    | Dashboard           | Population-level data      | Trend analysis   | Monthly updates       |
    Then communications should be appropriate
    And hope should be preserved
    And data should support messages
    And questions should be anticipated

  # Error Handling and Edge Cases
  @analytics @outcome-prediction @error @incomplete-data @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle outcome predictions with incomplete data
    Given some students have missing assessment data
    When attempting predictions with gaps:
      | Student ID | Missing Data Type    | Data Completeness | Prediction Possible | Alternative Approach    | Communication         |
      | S001      | Baseline measures    | 60%              | Limited            | Use intake estimates    | "Preliminary only"    |

    Then data gaps should be acknowledged
    And predictions should reflect uncertainty
    And data collection should be prioritized
    And stakeholders should understand limitations

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @error @unexpected-changes @not-implemented
  Scenario: Adjust predictions for unexpected changes
    Given initial predictions have been made
    When significant changes occur:

    And change impacts should be quantified
    And new plans should be developed
    And support should be adjusted

  @analytics @outcome-prediction @error @model-limitations @not-implemented
  Scenario: Communicate model limitations and uncertainty
    Given all models have inherent limitations
    When presenting predictions with uncertainty:
      | Prediction Scenario      | Confidence Level | Uncertainty Sources        | Limitations Disclosed        | Alternative Scenarios  |

      | Labeling effects      | "Poor prognosis" label      | Reduced effort     | Strengths-based framing  | Positive language    |
      | Family burden         | Pessimistic prediction      | Emotional harm     | Hope with realism        | Support resources    |
      | Insurance impacts     | Outcome limits coverage     | Financial harm     | Advocate for needs       | Medical necessity    |
      | Self-fulfilling       | Low expectations set        | Reduced outcomes   | Growth mindset approach  | Regular revision     |
      | Equity concerns       | Bias in predictions         | Discrimination     | Bias monitoring          | Fairness metrics     |
    Then ethical safeguards should be in place
    And human dignity should be preserved
    And predictions should empower, not limit
    And regular review should occur
