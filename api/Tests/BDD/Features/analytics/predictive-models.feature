Feature: Student Progress Prediction and Risk Assessment
  As a therapy professional
  I want AI-powered predictions of student progress and risk factors
  So that I can proactively adjust interventions and prevent regression

  Background:
    Given predictive analytics system is configured
    And historical therapy data is available
    And machine learning models are trained
    And prediction confidence thresholds are set
    And intervention recommendations are enabled

  # Core Predictive Model Workflows
  @analytics @predictive-models @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Predict student progress across therapy goals
    Given I have students with ongoing therapy programs
    And sufficient historical data exists for predictions
    When analyzing progress predictions:
      | Student ID | Current Goal      | Baseline | Current Level | Sessions | Predicted 30-Day | Predicted 90-Day | Confidence | Risk Factors           |
      | S001      | Articulation /r/  | 20%      | 65%          | 24       | 78%             | 92%             | 87%        | None identified        |
      | S002      | Fine motor grip   | 15%      | 45%          | 18       | 52%             | 71%             | 75%        | Inconsistent attendance|
      | S003      | Social skills     | 30%      | 40%          | 30       | 42%             | 48%             | 68%        | Plateau detected       |
      | S004      | Reading fluency   | 50 WPM   | 87 WPM       | 36       | 95 WPM          | 115 WPM         | 91%        | Strong trajectory      |

    Then predictions should be based on evidence
    And confidence levels should reflect data quality
    And risk factors should be clearly identified
    And recommendations should be actionable

  @analytics @predictive-models @regression-risk @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Identify students at risk of regression
    Given regression patterns are analyzed from historical data
    And environmental factors are considered
    When assessing regression risk:
      | Student ID | Risk Level | Primary Factors          | Time Horizon | Probability | Preventive Actions      | Alert Status |
      | S001      | Low        | Strong home support      | 3 months     | 15%        | Continue current plan   | Normal      |
      | S002      | High       | Extended break coming    | 1 month      | 75%        | Increase home program   | Alert sent  |
      | S003      | Medium     | Reduced session frequency| 2 months     | 45%        | Add group sessions      | Warning     |
      | S004      | Critical   | Medical procedure planned| 2 weeks      | 85%        | Intensive prep program  | Urgent      |

      | S006      | Medium     | Transition to new school | 6 weeks      | 55%        | Transition support plan | Warning     |
    Then high-risk students should be flagged immediately
    And preventive interventions should be suggested
    And families should be notified appropriately
    And progress monitoring should intensify

  @analytics @predictive-models @outcome-factors @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Analyze factors influencing therapy outcomes
    Given multiple variables affect therapy success

    Then effectiveness predictions should be data-driven
    And confidence intervals should be provided
    And trade-offs should be clearly presented
    And clinical judgment should be supported

  @analytics @predictive-models @resource-optimization @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Optimize resource allocation based on predicted needs

  @analytics @predictive-models @error @model-drift @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and handle model drift over time
    Given model performance can degrade

  Scenario: Address ethical concerns in predictive analytics
    Given predictions can impact student services
    When ethical issues arise:
      | Ethical Concern         | Scenario Example           | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy      | Oversight Required | Documentation      |
      | Bias amplification      | Low SES underprediction   | High      | Bias correction applied  | Ethics committee   | Audit trail        |
      | Self-fulfilling prophecy| Low expectations set      | Critical  | Predictions not shared   | Clinical review    | Usage guidelines   |
      | Resource gatekeeping    | Services denied by model  | High      | Human override required  | Supervisor approval| Decision log       |
      | Privacy violations      | Identifiable predictions  | Critical  | Aggregation only        | Privacy officer    | Data handling doc  |
      | Discrimination risk     | Protected class patterns  | Critical  | Features excluded       | Legal review       | Compliance cert    |
      | Consent issues          | Predictive profiling      | Medium    | Opt-in required         | Parent agreement   | Consent forms      |
    Then ethical safeguards should be enforced
    And human oversight should be mandatory
    And transparency should be maintained
    And fairness should be continuously monitored
