  @performance @database @query-optimization @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Test database query optimization across therapy data models
    Given therapy platform requires efficient data access patterns
    When database query performance is tested across data types:
      | Data Model Type        | Query Complexity | Target Response Time | Record Volume    | Index Strategy     |
      | Student records        | Simple lookup    | <25ms               | 100K records     | Primary key index  |

      | Marketplace items      | Complex filters  | <300ms              | 250K records     | Multi-column index |
    Then all database queries should meet response time targets
    And query execution plans should be optimized

      | Connection pool exhaustion| Variable   | Queue management     | Slower responses    |
    Then connection failures should be detected quickly
    And automatic reconnection should restore service
    And application should gracefully degrade when database unavailable
    And connection health should be monitored continuously

  @performance @database @error @query-timeouts @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle database query timeouts and long-running operations
    Given some database queries may exceed reasonable execution time

      | Lock resources       | >90% of limit       | Lock timeout reduction| Deadlock resolution |
    Then resource exhaustion should be prevented through monitoring

      | Memory exhaustion     | Query failures        | Query prioritization | Resource quotas      |
    Then database failures should be contained effectively
    And cascade prevention should maintain service availability
    And failure recovery should be coordinated across services
    And database health should be continuously monitored and maintained
