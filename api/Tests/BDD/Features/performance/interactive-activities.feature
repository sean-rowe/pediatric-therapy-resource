      | Mobile gestures limited | Single-touch adaptation   | Basic interactions    | Maintained performance|
    Then activities should gracefully degrade on unsupported devices
    And core functionality should remain available
    And fallback options should be clearly communicated
    And performance should not suffer due to compatibility layers
