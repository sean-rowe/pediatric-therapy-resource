  # Core API Response Time Testing
  @performance @api @response-time @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate API response times across all endpoint categories
    Given API endpoints are categorized by complexity and usage
    When API response times are tested across endpoint types:
      | Endpoint Category       | Endpoint Examples              | Response Time Target | Concurrent Requests | Success Rate |
      | Authentication APIs     | login, logout, refresh-token   | <200ms              | 5,000              | >99.5%      |
      | Student data retrieval  | get-student, get-caseload      | <300ms              | 10,000             | >99.0%      |
      | Resource search APIs    | search, filter, suggestions    | <400ms              | 15,000             | >98.5%      |
      | Content delivery APIs   | download, stream, preview      | <500ms              | 8,000              | >98.0%      |
      | Session documentation   | save-notes, update-progress    | <250ms              | 3,000              | >99.5%      |
      | Marketplace APIs        | browse, purchase, seller-data  | <400ms              | 5,000              | >98.0%      |
      | Assessment APIs         | submit-scores, get-reports     | <350ms              | 2,000              | >99.0%      |
      | Administrative APIs     | user-management, system-config | <600ms              | 500                | >97.0%      |
    Then all API endpoints should meet their response time targets
    And response times should be consistent across requests
    And system should handle concurrent load without degradation
    And error rates should remain below acceptable thresholds

  @performance @api @crud-operations @not-implemented

      | Student records        | <150ms     | <100ms   | <200ms     | <100ms     | 100 records/sec |

      | Marketplace items      | <250ms     | <100ms   | <300ms     | <150ms     | 75 records/sec  |
    Then CRUD operations should complete within target timeframes
    And batch operations should efficiently handle multiple records
    And data consistency should be maintained across operations
    And concurrent CRUD operations should not interfere with each other

  @performance @api @database-queries @not-implemented

      | Full-text search queries  | Medium     | <300ms       | 1K records   | Search indexes     |
    Then database queries should complete within performance targets
    And query plans should be optimized for each operation type
    And indexes should be utilized effectively
    And query performance should scale with data volume

  @performance @api @caching-effectiveness @not-implemented
  Scenario: Test API caching strategies and cache performance
    Given multi-level caching is implemented for API responses
    When API caching performance is tested:
      | Cache Level            | Cache Type    | Hit Rate Target | Response Time | TTL Strategy    |
      | Application cache      | In-memory     | >90%           | <10ms        | 15 minutes     |

      | Browser cache          | Client-side   | >80%           | Instant      | 1 hour         |
      | API response cache     | Distributed   | >88%           | <15ms        | Variable       |
    Then cache hit rates should meet target percentages
    And cache response times should be significantly faster than origin
    And cache invalidation should work correctly
    And cache miss scenarios should still meet API response targets

  @performance @api @rate-limiting @not-implemented
  Scenario: Test API rate limiting and throttling performance
    Given API rate limiting protects against abuse and overload

      | Anonymous users        | 100 req/hour     | 10 requests     | <100ms           | 1 hour       |
      | Basic subscribers      | 1000 req/hour    | 50 requests     | <50ms            | 1 hour       |
      | Pro subscribers        | 5000 req/hour    | 200 requests    | <25ms            | 1 hour       |
      | Enterprise users       | 20000 req/hour   | 1000 requests   | <10ms            | 1 hour       |

    Then rate limiting should be enforced accurately
    And throttling responses should be fast and informative
    And burst allowances should handle traffic spikes
    And rate limit recovery should work as configured

      | Analytics platforms    | Mixpanel API    | <2 seconds          | 10 second timeout| No retries      |
    Then third-party integrations should meet response targets

    And automatic recovery should restore full service

  @performance @api @error @resource-exhaustion @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle API resource exhaustion scenarios

      | Network partitions     | Split-brain scenarios| Quorum consensus     | Reduced availability |
    Then data consistency should be prioritized over performance
    And consistency mechanisms should be efficient
    And eventual consistency should be acceptable where appropriate
    And conflict resolution should be automatic and fair
