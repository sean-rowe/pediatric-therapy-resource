  As a performance engineer
  I want comprehensive video streaming performance validation
  So that therapy videos deliver optimal quality and performance under load

  Background:
    Given video streaming infrastructure is configured
    And CDN distribution is optimized
    And adaptive bitrate streaming is enabled
    And video quality metrics are monitored

  # Core Video Streaming Performance
  @performance @video @concurrent-streams @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle 10K concurrent video streams with optimal quality
    Given the platform supports high-volume video streaming
    When concurrent video streaming load is tested:
      | Stream Count | Video Quality | Target Bitrate | Buffer Health | Success Rate |
      | 1,000       | 1080p        | 5 Mbps        | >95%         | >99.5%      |
      | 2,500       | 1080p        | 5 Mbps        | >90%         | >99.0%      |
      | 5,000       | 1080p        | 4 Mbps        | >85%         | >98.5%      |
      | 7,500       | 720p         | 3 Mbps        | >80%         | >98.0%      |
      | 10,000      | 720p         | 2.5 Mbps      | >75%         | >97.5%      |
    Then video streaming should maintain stable quality
    And buffering events should be minimized
    And stream startup time should be under 3 seconds
    And video quality should adapt based on network conditions

  @performance @video @adaptive-bitrate @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate adaptive bitrate streaming effectiveness
    Given adaptive bitrate streaming is implemented
    When network conditions vary during streaming:
      | Network Condition    | Available Bandwidth | Target Quality | Adaptation Time | Buffer Impact |
      | Excellent (WiFi)     | 25 Mbps           | 1080p 60fps   | N/A            | >95% full    |
      | Good (4G)           | 10 Mbps           | 1080p 30fps   | <2 seconds     | >90% full    |
      | Fair (3G)           | 3 Mbps            | 720p 30fps    | <3 seconds     | >85% full    |
      | Poor (2G)           | 1 Mbps            | 480p 15fps    | <5 seconds     | >70% full    |
      | Unstable connection | Variable          | Adaptive      | <2 seconds     | >60% full    |
    Then video quality should adapt automatically to network conditions
    And adaptation should be smooth without interruption
    And buffer health should be maintained during transitions
    And user experience should remain acceptable across all conditions

  @performance @video @geographic-distribution @not-implemented
  Scenario: Test video streaming performance across global regions
    Given CDN is deployed globally for video delivery
    When video streaming is tested from multiple geographic locations:
      | Geographic Region    | Expected Latency | CDN Edge Distance | Target Quality | Local Cache Hit |
      | North America East   | <50ms           | <500 miles       | 1080p         | >95%           |

      | South America       | <200ms          | <2500 miles      | 720p          | >75%           |
      | Remote locations    | <300ms          | >3000 miles      | 480p          | >60%           |
    Then CDN should deliver content from nearest edge locations
    And cache hit rates should be optimized for each region
    And video quality should be appropriate for regional infrastructure
    And latency should meet regional performance targets

  @performance @video @mobile-optimization @not-implemented
  Scenario: Optimize video streaming for mobile devices and networks
    Given mobile video streaming is optimized

      | Budget smartphone   | 3G          | 480p H.264     | <25%/hour     | 150MB/hour   |
      | Tablet (WiFi)       | WiFi        | 1080p H.265    | <10%/hour     | 600MB/hour   |
      | Tablet (Cellular)   | 4G          | 720p H.264     | <15%/hour     | 400MB/hour   |
    Then mobile video should be optimized for device capabilities

      | 1080p H.264        | 500MB     | <3 minutes            | 720p, 480p, 360p  | >98%         |
      | 720p MOV           | 200MB     | <90 seconds           | 480p, 360p        | >98%         |
      | Raw upload formats | Variable  | <2x video length      | All standard       | >95%         |
    Then transcoding should complete within target timeframes
    And multiple output formats should be generated automatically
    And video quality should be preserved across formats
    And processing queue should handle peak upload volumes

  @performance @video @live-streaming @not-implemented
  Scenario: Support real-time therapy session streaming
    Given live streaming capability is available
    When real-time therapy sessions are streamed:
      | Session Type        | Participants | Stream Quality | Latency Target | Interaction Support |
      | Individual therapy  | 2           | 1080p         | <200ms        | Chat, annotations  |
      | Group therapy       | 6           | 720p          | <300ms        | Multi-participant  |
      | Training session    | 25          | 720p          | <500ms        | Q&A, polling      |

    Then live streams should maintain low latency
    And real-time interaction should be supported
    And stream quality should adapt to participant count
    And recording should be available for later review

  @performance @video @interactive-features @not-implemented
  Scenario: Test interactive video features performance
    Given interactive video features are implemented
    When interactive video elements are used during streaming:
      | Interactive Feature | Response Time Target | Concurrent Users | Accuracy Requirement |
      | Video annotations   | <100ms              | 1,000           | 100% sync           |

      | Standard security   | AES-128         | Weekly       | <10% overhead     | Role-based     |
      | High security       | AES-256         | Daily        | <15% overhead     | MFA required   |
      | Maximum security    | DRM protection  | Per session  | <25% overhead     | Device-specific|
    Then video encryption should not significantly impact performance
    And secure key management should be transparent to users
    And access controls should be enforced consistently
    And DRM protection should prevent unauthorized access

  @performance @video @content-delivery @not-implemented

  # Error Condition Scenarios
  @performance @video @error @network-instability @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle network instability during video streaming
    Given network conditions may be unstable
    When network issues occur during video streaming:

      | Intermittent drops  | Every 30s    | 2-5 seconds  | Seamless reconnection    |
      | Bandwidth reduction | Gradual      | 10+ seconds  | Quality adaptation       |
      | Complete loss       | Rare         | 5-10 seconds | Pause and buffer         |

      | Packet loss         | 5-10%        | Continuous   | Error correction         |
    Then video streaming should handle network instability gracefully
    And user experience should be minimally impacted
    And automatic recovery should be attempted
    And quality should adapt to available bandwidth

  @performance @video @error @server-overload @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle video server overload conditions
    Given video servers may experience high load
    When server capacity is exceeded:
      | Overload Scenario   | Server Load  | Response Strategy         | User Impact              |
      | Peak usage hours    | 90-95%      | Auto-scaling activation   | Minimal degradation      |
      | Viral content spike | 95-100%     | Load balancer distribution| Slight quality reduction |

      | Primary storage down| Regional        | Failover to secondary    | 99.9% availability     |
      | CDN node failure    | Local          | Route to alternate nodes | Increased latency      |
      | Backup system issues| Archival       | Multiple backup copies   | No immediate impact    |
      | Database corruption | Metadata       | Replica synchronization  | Temporary metadata loss|
      | Network partition   | Multi-region   | Regional independence    | Regional availability  |
    Then video content should remain accessible during storage issues

      | Transcoding timeout | Large files     | Retry with extended time | Processing status      |
      | Format unsupported  | Rare codecs     | Manual review process    | Format requirements    |
      | Storage write error | Disk full       | Cleanup and retry        | Temporary delay notice |
      | Processing queue full| High volume    | Queue management         | Processing time estimate|
    Then processing failures should be handled gracefully
    And users should receive clear feedback about processing status
    And retry mechanisms should handle temporary failures
    And manual intervention should be available for complex issues
