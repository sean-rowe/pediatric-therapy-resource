  As a performance engineer
  I want comprehensive load testing capabilities
  So that the platform performs optimally under high user loads

  Background:
    Given the load testing environment is configured
    And performance monitoring is active
    And baseline metrics are established

  # Core Load Testing Scenarios
  @performance @load @concurrent-users @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle 250K concurrent users with acceptable performance
    Given the platform is configured for high load
    When load testing is executed with increasing user counts:
      | User Count | Ramp-up Time | Sustain Duration | Target Response Time | Success Rate |
      | 10,000     | 2 minutes   | 5 minutes       | <500ms              | >99.5%      |
      | 50,000     | 5 minutes   | 10 minutes      | <750ms              | >99.0%      |
      | 100,000    | 10 minutes  | 15 minutes      | <1000ms             | >98.5%      |
      | 200,000    | 15 minutes  | 20 minutes      | <1500ms             | >98.0%      |
      | 250,000    | 20 minutes  | 30 minutes      | <2000ms             | >97.5%      |
    Then response times should remain within target thresholds
    And error rates should stay below maximum acceptable levels
    And system resources should not exceed 80% utilization
    And auto-scaling should maintain performance during load increases

  @performance @load @api-throughput @not-implemented
  Scenario: Sustain 50K API calls per second with low latency
    Given API endpoints are optimized for high throughput
    When API load testing is performed:
      | API Endpoint Type        | Target RPS | Max Latency | Error Rate | Load Pattern    |
      | Authentication APIs      | 10,000     | 200ms      | <0.1%     | Constant       |
      | Student data retrieval   | 15,000     | 300ms      | <0.1%     | Peak/valley    |
      | Resource downloads       | 8,000      | 500ms      | <0.5%     | Burst traffic  |
      | Session documentation    | 5,000      | 400ms      | <0.1%     | Business hours |
      | Payment processing       | 1,000      | 1000ms     | <0.01%    | Steady         |
      | Administrative functions | 500        | 2000ms     | <0.1%     | Low volume     |
      | Search operations        | 12,000     | 800ms      | <0.2%     | Variable spikes|
    Then API throughput targets should be consistently met
    And latency should remain within acceptable bounds
    And error rates should not exceed defined thresholds
    And API rate limiting should function correctly under load

  @performance @load @database-performance @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate database performance under concurrent load
    Given database cluster is configured for high performance
    When database load testing is executed:
      | Operation Type          | Concurrent Ops | Target Latency | Throughput Target | Connection Pool |
      | Student record reads    | 5,000         | <50ms         | 10,000 ops/sec   | 200 connections|
      | Therapy session writes  | 2,000         | <100ms        | 3,000 ops/sec    | 100 connections|
      | Complex report queries  | 100           | <5000ms       | 50 queries/sec   | 50 connections |
      | Full-text searches      | 1,000         | <200ms        | 1,500 ops/sec    | 75 connections |
      | Bulk data operations    | 10            | <30000ms      | Variable         | 20 connections |
    Then database response times should meet targets
    And connection pooling should efficiently manage connections
    And database CPU utilization should remain below 70%
    And query performance should not degrade with concurrent load

  @performance @load @file-storage @not-implemented
  Scenario: Test file storage performance under high concurrent access
    Given file storage system handles therapy videos and documents
    When file operations are load tested:
      | File Operation Type     | Concurrent Ops | File Size Range | Target Throughput | Success Rate |
      | Document uploads        | 1,000         | 1-10 MB        | 500 MB/sec       | >99%        |
      | Video uploads           | 200           | 50-500 MB      | 2 GB/sec         | >98%        |
      | Document downloads      | 5,000         | 1-10 MB        | 1 GB/sec         | >99.5%      |
      | Video streaming         | 2,000         | 100-500 MB     | 5 GB/sec         | >99%        |
      | Thumbnail generation    | 500           | 10-50 MB       | 100 files/sec    | >99%        |
    Then file operations should maintain consistent performance
    And storage bandwidth should be efficiently utilized
    And CDN performance should improve global access times
    And file integrity should be maintained under high load

  # Stress Testing Scenarios
  @performance @load @stress-testing @not-implemented
  Scenario: Determine system breaking points and failure modes
    Given stress testing protocols are established
    When system load is incrementally increased beyond normal capacity:
      | Load Level        | User Multiplier | Resource Usage | Expected Behavior            |
      | Normal operation  | 1x             | <70%          | Optimal performance         |
      | High load         | 2x             | 70-85%        | Acceptable performance      |
      | Stress level      | 3x             | 85-95%        | Degraded but functional     |
      | Breaking point    | 4-5x           | >95%          | Graceful degradation        |
      | Failure threshold | >5x            | 100%          | Circuit breakers activate   |
    Then system should gracefully degrade rather than crash
    And critical functions should remain available during stress
    And auto-scaling should activate to handle increased load
    And monitoring should provide clear visibility into system state

  @performance @load @spike-testing @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle sudden traffic spikes effectively
    Given the system experiences sudden traffic increases
    When traffic spikes are simulated:
      | Spike Scenario       | Normal Load | Spike Load | Duration | Recovery Time Target |
      | Back-to-school rush  | 10,000 users| 100,000   | 2 hours | <5 minutes          |
      | Breaking news event  | 15,000 users| 80,000    | 30 min  | <3 minutes          |
      | New feature launch   | 12,000 users| 60,000    | 1 hour  | <5 minutes          |
      | System maintenance   | 0 users     | 50,000    | 15 min  | <2 minutes          |
    Then auto-scaling should respond within target timeframes
    And performance should recover quickly after spikes
    And user experience should remain acceptable during spikes
    And no data loss should occur during traffic surges

  # Endurance Testing
  @performance @load @endurance-testing @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate system stability over extended periods
    Given endurance testing runs for extended durations
    When system operates under sustained load:
      | Test Duration | Load Level      | Monitoring Focus           | Acceptance Criteria        |
      | 24 hours     | 75% capacity   | Memory leaks, performance  | No degradation            |
      | 72 hours     | 50% capacity   | Resource usage patterns    | Stable resource usage     |
      | 1 week       | 60% capacity   | Long-term stability        | No failures or restarts   |
      | 30 days      | 40% capacity   | Gradual degradation        | <5% performance decrease  |
    Then system should maintain stable performance over time
    And memory usage should not continuously increase
    And no resource leaks should be detected
    And database performance should remain consistent

  # Realistic User Behavior Testing
  @performance @load @user-scenarios @not-implemented
  Scenario: Simulate realistic therapist workflow patterns
    Given user behavior models are based on actual usage patterns
    When realistic user scenarios are load tested:
      | User Scenario Type    | User Count | Session Duration | Actions per Session | Peak Hours        |
      | Morning session prep  | 15,000    | 15 minutes      | 25 actions         | 7-9 AM           |
      | Active therapy time   | 30,000    | 45 minutes      | 50 actions         | 9 AM-3 PM        |
      | Documentation period  | 20,000    | 30 minutes      | 35 actions         | 3-5 PM           |

      | Weekend catch-up      | 5,000     | 60 minutes      | 40 actions         | Weekends         |
    Then user workflows should complete within acceptable timeframes
    And concurrent user sessions should not interfere with each other
    And resource access patterns should match expected usage
    And peak hour performance should meet service level agreements

  @performance @load @geographic-distribution @not-implemented
  Scenario: Test performance across geographic regions
    Given users access the platform from multiple global regions
    When geographic load testing is performed:
      | Geographic Region    | User Count | Network Latency | CDN Performance | Local Response Time |
      | North America East   | 100,000   | 20-50ms        | <100ms         | <300ms             |
      | North America West   | 80,000    | 30-70ms        | <150ms         | <400ms             |

      | Asia Pacific        | 25,000    | 150-250ms      | <300ms         | <800ms             |
      | South America       | 10,000    | 100-200ms      | <250ms         | <600ms             |
    Then global performance should meet regional SLAs
    And CDN should effectively reduce latency
    And content delivery should be optimized for each region
    And failover should work seamlessly across regions

  # Performance Monitoring and Alerting
  @performance @load @monitoring @not-implemented
  Scenario: Monitor system performance during load testing
    Given comprehensive performance monitoring is active
    When load tests are executed:
      | Monitoring Category  | Metrics Tracked                    | Alert Thresholds           |
      | Application metrics  | Response time, throughput, errors  | >1s response, >1% errors  |
      | Infrastructure      | CPU, memory, disk, network I/O    | >80% utilization          |

      | User experience     | Page load time, interaction delay | >3s load time             |
    Then performance metrics should be collected in real-time
    And alerts should be triggered when thresholds are exceeded
    And dashboards should provide clear visibility into system health
    And historical data should be available for trend analysis

  # Error Condition Scenarios
  @performance @load @error @resource-exhaustion @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle resource exhaustion gracefully during peak load
    Given system resources may become exhausted under extreme load
    When resource limits are reached:
      | Resource Type       | Exhaustion Scenario              | Expected Response           |
      | Memory              | High concurrent user sessions    | Graceful session limiting   |
      | CPU                 | Complex computation requests     | Request queuing             |

      | Network bandwidth   | Video streaming spike           | Quality adaptation          |
    Then system should implement graceful degradation
    And critical functions should remain available
    And resource usage should be monitored and managed
    And recovery should be automatic when resources become available

  @performance @load @error @cascading-failures @not-implemented
  Scenario: Prevent and handle cascading system failures
    Given one system component may fail under load
    When component failures occur during high load:
      | Failing Component   | Failure Type                     | Isolation Strategy          |
      | Primary database    | Connection timeout               | Failover to read replica    |
      | Authentication service| Service overload                | Cache authentication tokens |

      | Load balancer       | Instance failure                | Route to healthy instances  |
    Then failures should be isolated to prevent cascade
    And backup systems should activate automatically
    And service degradation should be minimal
    And recovery should be rapid when components are restored

  @performance @load @error @data-consistency @not-implemented
  Scenario: Maintain data consistency under high concurrent load
    Given concurrent operations may create data consistency challenges
    When high-concurrency scenarios stress data consistency:
      | Concurrency Scenario        | Data Consistency Risk           | Protection Mechanism        |
      | Simultaneous user updates   | Lost update problem            | Optimistic locking          |
      | Concurrent session creation | Duplicate session IDs          | Database constraints        |

      | Batch data operations       | Partial update failures        | Transaction boundaries      |
    Then data integrity should be maintained under all load conditions
    And consistency checks should validate data accuracy
    And conflict resolution should handle concurrent updates properly
    And audit logs should track all data modifications

  @performance @load @error @memory-leaks @not-implemented
  Scenario: Detect and prevent memory leaks during extended load testing
    Given extended load testing may reveal memory management issues
    When memory usage is monitored during long-running tests:

      | Database connections    | 12 hours           | Connections not released    |
      | Cache memory           | 6 hours            | Unbounded cache growth      |

      | File handles           | 4 hours            | File descriptors not closed |
    Then memory usage should remain stable over time
    And memory leaks should be detected and reported
    And automatic garbage collection should be effective
    And memory pressure should trigger appropriate cleanup

  @performance @load @error @network-partitions @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle network partitions and connectivity issues during load
    Given network issues may occur during high load periods
    When network connectivity problems arise:
      | Network Issue Type      | Impact on Load Testing          | Resilience Strategy         |
      | Regional network outage | Some users cannot connect      | Geographic failover         |
      | ISP connectivity issues | Degraded network performance   | CDN routing optimization    |
      | DDoS attack simulation  | Overwhelmed network capacity   | DDoS protection activation  |
      | DNS resolution failures | Service discovery problems     | Multiple DNS providers      |
      | SSL certificate issues  | Secure connection failures     | Certificate redundancy      |
    Then system should remain accessible from unaffected regions
    And performance should degrade gracefully during network issues
    And automatic recovery should occur when connectivity is restored
    And monitoring should clearly identify network-related performance issues
