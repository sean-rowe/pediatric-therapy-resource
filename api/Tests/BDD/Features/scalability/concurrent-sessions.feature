Feature: Concurrent Sessions Scalability and Real-time Interaction Management
  As a platform supporting massive concurrent usage
  I want to scale real-time sessions and interactions effectively
  So that millions of users can work simultaneously without degradation

  Background:
    Given concurrent session infrastructure is deployed
    And real-time communication systems are configured
    And session state management is distributed
    And connection pooling is optimized
    And monitoring systems track active sessions

  @scalability @concurrent @session-management @million-users @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Support millions of concurrent user sessions
    Given the platform must handle peak concurrent usage
    And each session maintains state and context
    When managing concurrent sessions at scale:
      | Session Type | Target Concurrency | Session Duration | State Size | Persistence Strategy | Distribution Method |
      | Web sessions | 5M concurrent | 30 min average | 10KB/session | Redis cluster | Geo-distributed |
      | Mobile sessions | 10M concurrent | 2 hour average | 5KB/session | In-memory + backup | Regional sharding |

      | Component | Scaling Strategy | Connection Limit | Message Throughput | Failover Method | Load Distribution |
      | Connection gateway | Horizontal scaling | 100K per instance | 1M msg/sec/instance | Graceful reconnect | Round-robin + affinity |

    And reconnection should be automatic

  @scalability @concurrent @state-synchronization @distributed-state @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Synchronize session state across distributed systems
    Given session state must be consistent
