Feature: Resource Limits and Constraint Management at Scale
  As a platform with finite resources
  I want to manage and enforce resource limits effectively
  So that the system remains stable under all load conditions

  Background:
    Given resource limit management is configured
    And monitoring systems track resource usage
    And enforcement mechanisms are active
    And quotas are defined per tier
    And alerting thresholds are established

  # Core Resource Limit Management
  @scalability @limits @quota-enforcement @multi-tier @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce resource quotas across service tiers
    Given different service tiers have different limits
    And quotas must be enforced fairly
    When implementing quota enforcement:
      | Service Tier | CPU Quota | Memory Limit | Storage Quota | API Calls/Hour | Concurrent Users | Network Bandwidth |
      | Free tier | 0.5 vCPU | 512MB | 1GB | 1,000 | 5 | 10 Mbps |
      | Basic tier | 2 vCPU | 2GB | 50GB | 10,000 | 50 | 100 Mbps |
      | Professional | 8 vCPU | 8GB | 500GB | 100,000 | 500 | 1 Gbps |
      | Enterprise | 32 vCPU | 32GB | 5TB | 1,000,000 | 5,000 | 10 Gbps |
      | Unlimited | No limit | No limit | 50TB | 10,000,000 | 50,000 | 100 Gbps |
      | Custom | Negotiated | Negotiated | Negotiated | Negotiated | Negotiated | Negotiated |
    Then quotas should be enforced strictly
    And usage should be tracked accurately
    And violations should be handled gracefully
    And upgrades should be suggested appropriately

  @scalability @limits @rate-limiting @api-throttling @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement sophisticated rate limiting with burst capacity
    Given API rate limits prevent abuse
    And legitimate bursts should be allowed
    When implementing rate limiting:
      | API Endpoint | Rate Limit | Burst Capacity | Window Type | Penalty Duration | Override Conditions |
      | Authentication | 10/minute | 20 burst | Sliding window | 5 min lockout | 2FA enabled: 2x |
      | Search API | 100/minute | 200 burst | Fixed window | Progressive backoff | Paid tier: 10x |
      | Data upload | 50MB/hour | 100MB burst | Rolling window | 1 hour throttle | Enterprise: unlimited |
      | Report generation | 10/hour | 15 burst | Token bucket | Queue position | Priority access |
      | Webhook delivery | 1000/hour | 2000 burst | Leaky bucket | Exponential backoff | Verified endpoint: 2x |
      | Analytics API | 500/hour | 1000 burst | Sliding log | Soft throttle | Internal use: bypass |
    Then rate limits should be enforced
    And bursts should be handled appropriately
    And penalties should be proportional
    And legitimate use should not be impacted

  @scalability @limits @memory-management @oom-prevention @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Manage memory limits and prevent out-of-memory conditions
    Given memory is a critical finite resource
    And OOM conditions must be prevented
    When implementing memory management:
      | Component | Memory Allocation | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | OOM Score | Eviction Policy |
      | Application pods | 2GB baseline | 3GB warning | 4GB kill | -500 (protected) | Least recently used |
      | Cache layers | 16GB allocated | 14GB pressure | 15GB eviction | 0 (neutral) | LRU with TTL |
      | Database connections | 100MB per conn | 150MB warning | 200MB close | -1000 (never kill) | Idle timeout |
      | Background jobs | 1GB per job | 1.5GB throttle | 2GB terminate | 500 (killable) | Job checkpoint |
      | User sessions | 10MB per session | 15MB warning | 20MB cleanup | 200 (expendable) | Inactive first |
      | File buffers | Dynamic | 80% available | 90% flush | 800 (very killable) | Write and release |
    Then memory usage should be controlled
    And OOM conditions should be rare
    And critical services should be protected
    And performance should degrade gracefully

  @scalability @limits @cpu-throttling @compute-fairness @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement CPU throttling and compute fairness
    Given CPU resources must be shared fairly
    And throttling prevents resource monopolization
    When implementing CPU limits:
      | Process Type | CPU Shares | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Nice Priority | Throttle Behavior |
      | User requests | 1024 shares | 80% CPU | 100% CPU | 0 (normal) | Gradual throttle |
      | Background jobs | 512 shares | 50% CPU | 70% CPU | 10 (lower) | Immediate throttle |
      | System processes | 2048 shares | No limit | No limit | -5 (higher) | Never throttle |
      | Analytics | 256 shares | 30% CPU | 50% CPU | 15 (lowest) | Aggressive throttle |
      | Real-time features | 4096 shares | 90% CPU | No limit | -10 (highest) | Minimal throttle |
      | Maintenance tasks | 128 shares | 20% CPU | 30% CPU | 19 (idle) | Stop when busy |
    Then CPU usage should be fair
    And high-priority tasks should get resources
    And system should remain responsive
    And starvation should be prevented

      | Log storage | 100GB rolling | 90% warn | 100% rotate | Immediate | Delete oldest |
      | Backup storage | 5TB reserved | 80% notify | 90% compress | 30 days | Incremental only |
      | Cache storage | 500GB dynamic | No warning | LRU eviction | N/A | Automatic cleanup |
      | Temp files | 50GB shared | 70% clean | 90% aggressive | Immediate | Age-based deletion |

    When implementing I/O limits:
      | Workload Type | Read IOPS | Write IOPS | Read Bandwidth | Write Bandwidth | Priority Class |
      | Database primary | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Critical |
      | Database replica | 10,000 | 5,000 | 1 GB/s | 500 MB/s | High |
      | User uploads | 1,000 | 2,000 | 100 MB/s | 200 MB/s | Normal |
      | Backup operations | 500 | 1,000 | 50 MB/s | 100 MB/s | Low |

      | Media streaming | 500 Mbps | 5 Gbps | 500 MB | Medium | Leaky bucket |
      | Backup traffic | 50 Mbps | 500 Mbps | 50 MB | Low | Hierarchical |
      | Replication | 200 Mbps | 2 Gbps | 200 MB | Critical | Guaranteed rate |
      | User downloads | 10 Mbps/user | 100 Mbps/user | 10 MB | Normal | Fair queuing |
      | System updates | 10 Mbps | 100 Mbps | 0 | Lowest | Best effort |
    Then bandwidth should be allocated fairly
