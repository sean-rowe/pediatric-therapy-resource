Feature: Geographic Distribution and Global Platform Scalability
  As a globally distributed platform
  I want to scale across geographic regions effectively
  So that users worldwide receive optimal performance

  Background:
    Given geographic distribution infrastructure is deployed
    And multi-region architecture is configured
    And data replication strategies are defined
    And latency requirements are established
    And regional compliance requirements are known

  # Core Geographic Distribution
  @scalability @geographic @multi-region @global-architecture @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Deploy and manage services across multiple geographic regions
    Given the platform serves users globally
    And each region has specific requirements
    When implementing multi-region deployment:
      | Region | Primary Services | Data Residency | Latency Target | Availability Target | Compliance Requirements |
      | US-East (Virginia) | API, Database master | HIPAA-compliant data | <50ms regional | 99.99% | HIPAA, COPPA, CCPA |
      | US-West (Oregon) | API, Database replica | Disaster recovery | <50ms regional | 99.95% | HIPAA, COPPA, CCPA |
      | EU-West (Ireland) | API, Database master | GDPR-compliant data | <50ms regional | 99.99% | GDPR, UK GDPR |
      | EU-Central (Frankfurt) | API, Database replica | German data residency | <50ms regional | 99.95% | GDPR, BDSG |
      | APAC (Singapore) | API, Database master | APAC data residency | <100ms regional | 99.9% | PDPA, PIPEDA |
      | APAC (Sydney) | API, Database replica | Australian data | <50ms regional | 99.9% | Australian Privacy Act |
    Then services should be deployed successfully
    And regional isolation should be maintained
    And latency targets should be met
    And compliance boundaries should be enforced

  @scalability @geographic @data-replication @consistency-models @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement cross-region data replication with consistency guarantees
    Given data must be replicated across regions
    And consistency requirements vary by data type
    When configuring replication strategies:
      | Data Type | Consistency Model | Replication Method | Conflict Resolution | Lag Tolerance | Failover RPO |
      | User profiles | Eventually consistent | Async multi-master | Last write wins | <5 seconds | 1 minute |
      | Therapy sessions | Strong consistency | Sync replication | Primary region wins | 0 seconds | 0 seconds |
      | Educational content | Read-after-write | Async with cache | Version control | <30 seconds | 5 minutes |
      | Analytics data | Eventual consistency | Batch replication | Merge aggregates | <5 minutes | 1 hour |
      | Payment data | Strong consistency | Sync with 2PC | No conflicts | 0 seconds | 0 seconds |
      | Media files | Eventually consistent | CDN replication | Checksum validation | <2 minutes | 15 minutes |
    Then replication should maintain consistency
    And conflicts should be resolved automatically
    And lag should remain within tolerance
    And failover should meet RPO targets

  @scalability @geographic @edge-computing @pop-deployment @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Deploy edge computing points of presence globally
    Given edge computing reduces latency
    And PoPs must be strategically located
    When deploying edge infrastructure:
      | PoP Location | Coverage Area | Services Deployed | Cache Size | Compute Capacity | Peering Arrangements |
      | New York | US Northeast | CDN, API cache, Auth | 10TB | 100 vCPUs | Major ISPs |
      | Los Angeles | US West Coast | CDN, API cache | 8TB | 80 vCPUs | Regional ISPs |
      | London | UK/Ireland | CDN, API cache, GDPR | 8TB | 80 vCPUs | EU exchanges |

      | Tokyo | Japan/Korea | CDN, API cache | 8TB | 80 vCPUs | Regional peers |
    Then PoPs should serve regional traffic
    And cache hit rates should exceed 90%
    And latency should be minimized
    And costs should be optimized

  @scalability @geographic @traffic-routing @intelligent-dns @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Route traffic intelligently based on geography and performance
    Given users should connect to optimal endpoints
    And routing must consider multiple factors
    When implementing intelligent routing:
      | Routing Factor | Weight | Measurement Method | Update Frequency | Override Capability | Fallback Strategy |
      | Geographic proximity | 40% | GeoIP database | Real-time | Manual override | Nearest region |
      | Endpoint health | 30% | Health checks | 10-second intervals | Auto-exclude unhealthy | Next nearest healthy |
      | Current load | 20% | Real-time metrics | 30-second intervals | Load threshold | Load balancing |
      | Network performance | 10% | BGP anycast | Continuous | ISP preference | Default route |
      | Cost optimization | Variable | Transfer pricing | Hourly | Budget limits | Cheapest path |
      | Compliance requirements | Override | Data residency rules | Per request | Mandatory | Compliant region only |
    Then routing should be optimal
    And performance should be consistent
    And compliance should be maintained
    And failover should be seamless

  # Regional Scaling Strategies
  @scalability @geographic @regional-autonomy @independent-scaling @critical @not-implemented

      | Edge PoPs | Centralized | 50 instances each | $5k/month each | Global metrics | All changes |
    Then regions should scale independently
    And resource limits should be enforced
    And budgets should be tracked
    And coordination should occur when needed

  @scalability @geographic @disaster-recovery @regional-failover @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement cross-region disaster recovery and failover
    Given regional failures must not impact global availability
    And failover must be rapid and automatic

      | Failure Scenario | Detection Time | Failover Time | Data Loss (RPO) | Recovery Time (RTO) | Failback Strategy |
      | Region unavailable | <30 seconds | <2 minutes | <1 minute | <5 minutes | Automated when healthy |
      | Network partition | <1 minute | <3 minutes | 0 (split-brain handling) | <10 minutes | Manual validation |
      | Data center loss | <30 seconds | <2 minutes | <5 minutes | <15 minutes | Rebuild required |
      | Partial failure | <2 minutes | <5 minutes | 0 (degraded mode) | <30 minutes | Gradual recovery |
      | Compliance violation | Immediate | Immediate | 0 (reroute only) | 0 (reroute) | When compliant |
      | Cascading failure | <1 minute | Progressive | Varies by service | <1 hour | Staged recovery |
    Then failover should be automatic
    And data loss should be minimal
    And recovery should meet targets
    And service should remain available

  @scalability @geographic @data-sovereignty @compliance-routing @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce data sovereignty and regional compliance requirements

      | Children's data | Origin country | Cross-border restricted | Enhanced protection | Parental consent | COPPA/similar |
      | Biometric data | Origin only | No cross-border | Strongest encryption | Minimal access | Special audit |
    Then data sovereignty should be enforced
    And cross-border transfers should be controlled
    And compliance should be automatic
    And violations should be prevented

  @scalability @geographic @performance-optimization @regional-caching @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Optimize performance through regional caching strategies
    Given caching strategies must be region-aware
    And cache coherence must be maintained
    When implementing regional caching:
      | Cache Layer | Regional Strategy | Invalidation Method | Coherence Protocol | Hit Rate Target | Update Propagation |
      | CDN static content | Regional PoPs | Event-based purge | Eventually consistent | >95% | <30 seconds global |
