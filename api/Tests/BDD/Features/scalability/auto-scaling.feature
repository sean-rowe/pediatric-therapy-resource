Feature: Auto-scaling and Dynamic Resource Management
  As a platform serving variable user loads
  I want automatic scaling of resources based on demand
  So that performance remains consistent during peak usage

  Background:
    Given auto-scaling infrastructure is configured
    And monitoring metrics are established
    And scaling policies are defined
    And cost controls are implemented
    And performance baselines are set

  # Core Auto-scaling
  @scalability @auto-scaling @horizontal-scaling @load-management @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Scale application instances based on CPU and memory usage
    Given the platform experiences variable load throughout the day
    And scaling triggers are configured for resource utilization
    When monitoring detects resource usage patterns:
      | Metric Type | Scale-Up Threshold | Scale-Down Threshold | Monitoring Period | Scaling Action | Cooldown Period |
      | CPU Usage | >70% for 5 minutes | <30% for 10 minutes | 1-minute intervals | Add 2 instances | 5 minutes |
      | Memory Usage | >80% for 3 minutes | <40% for 15 minutes | 30-second intervals | Add 1 instance | 3 minutes |
      | Request Queue | >1000 pending | <100 pending | Real-time | Add 3 instances | 2 minutes |
      | Response Time | >500ms p95 | <200ms p95 | 2-minute average | Add 2 instances | 5 minutes |
      | Error Rate | >1% requests | <0.1% requests | 5-minute window | Add 1 instance | 10 minutes |
      | Active Sessions | >1000 per instance | <200 per instance | Real-time count | Add proportionally | 3 minutes |
    Then auto-scaling should respond appropriately
    And new instances should be healthy before receiving traffic
    And load should be distributed evenly
    And performance should remain within SLA

  @scalability @auto-scaling @database-scaling @connection-pooling @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Scale database connections and read replicas dynamically
    Given database load varies with user activity
    And read/write patterns require different scaling approaches
    When database metrics indicate scaling needs:
      | Database Metric | Scale Trigger | Scaling Action | Implementation Method | Validation Check | Rollback Trigger |
      | Connection pool exhaustion | >90% connections used | Increase pool by 50% | Dynamic pool expansion | Connection availability | Error spike |
      | Query response time | >100ms average | Add read replica | Automated replica creation | Replication lag <1s | Lag >5s |
      | Write throughput | >10k writes/second | Scale up master | Vertical scaling | Write performance | Failed writes |
      | Read throughput | >50k reads/second | Add 2 read replicas | Horizontal read scaling | Read distribution | Uneven load |
      | Storage usage | >80% capacity | Expand storage 25% | Online storage expansion | Available space | Expansion failure |
      | Lock contention | >5% transactions waiting | Optimize or scale | Query optimization first | Lock wait time | Deadlocks |
    Then database scaling should maintain data consistency
    And applications should handle topology changes
    And performance should improve after scaling
    And costs should be monitored

  @scalability @auto-scaling @container-orchestration @kubernetes @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Orchestrate container scaling with Kubernetes HPA and VPA
    Given Kubernetes manages container orchestration
    And both horizontal and vertical scaling are needed
    When implementing pod autoscaling:
      | Scaling Type | Resource Target | Min Replicas | Max Replicas | Target Utilization | Scaling Behavior | Update Policy |
      | HPA - Web tier | CPU + Memory | 3 | 50 | 65% average | Conservative scale-up | Rolling update |
      | HPA - API tier | Request rate | 5 | 100 | 1000 req/s/pod | Aggressive scale-up | Blue-green |
      | VPA - Workers | Memory usage | N/A | N/A | Optimal sizing | Recommendation mode | Recreate pods |
      | HPA - Background | Queue length | 2 | 20 | 100 items/pod | Predictive scaling | Gradual |
      | Cluster autoscaler | Node pressure | 3 nodes | 50 nodes | 80% node usage | Proactive scaling | Zone-balanced |
      | HPA - Cache tier | Hit rate | 2 | 10 | Maintain 95% hits | Custom metrics | In-place |
    Then Kubernetes should manage scaling effectively
    And pod distribution should be optimal
    And node utilization should be efficient
    And scaling events should be logged

  @scalability @auto-scaling @predictive-scaling @ml-driven @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement predictive scaling based on usage patterns
    Given historical usage data shows predictable patterns
    And machine learning models can predict load
    When implementing predictive scaling:
      | Pattern Type | Prediction Model | Advance Scaling Time | Confidence Threshold | Override Capability | Learning Feedback |
      | Daily peak (9-11 AM) | Time-series forecast | 15 minutes early | 85% confidence | Manual override | Actual vs predicted |
      | Weekly therapy sessions | Seasonal ARIMA | 30 minutes early | 90% confidence | Calendar override | Session accuracy |
      | Monthly billing cycle | Cyclical pattern | 1 hour early | 95% confidence | Billing schedule | Transaction volume |
      | School year patterns | Academic calendar | 2 hours early | 80% confidence | District schedules | Enrollment data |
      | Special events | Event correlation | 4 hours early | 75% confidence | Event calendar | Event impact |
      | Weather correlation | External API | 1 hour early | 70% confidence | Weather alerts | Activity correlation |
    Then predictive scaling should anticipate load
    And resources should be ready before demand
    And prediction accuracy should improve over time
    And manual overrides should be available

  # Regional and Global Scaling
  @scalability @auto-scaling @multi-region @global-load @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Scale across multiple regions based on geographic demand
    Given users are distributed globally
    And regional performance requirements exist
    When implementing multi-region scaling:
      | Region | Base Capacity | Peak Capacity | Latency Target | Scaling Priority | Failover Region | Cost Factor |
      | US-East | 20 instances | 100 instances | <50ms | Primary | US-West | 1.0x |
      | US-West | 15 instances | 75 instances | <50ms | Secondary | US-East | 1.1x |
      | EU-West | 10 instances | 50 instances | <50ms | Primary EU | EU-Central | 1.3x |
      | EU-Central | 5 instances | 25 instances | <50ms | Secondary EU | EU-West | 1.2x |
      | APAC | 8 instances | 40 instances | <100ms | Primary APAC | US-West | 1.5x |
      | Disaster Recovery | 0 instances | Full capacity | <200ms | On-demand | Any available | 2.0x |
    Then regional scaling should meet local demand
    And cross-region traffic should be minimized
    And failover should be automatic
    And costs should be optimized by region

  @scalability @auto-scaling @service-mesh @traffic-management @high @not-implemented

      | User API | CPU-based HPA | 50% error rate | 3 retries, exponential | Round robin | 10% traffic |
      | Payment service | Queue depth | 5 consecutive errors | 2 retries, fixed delay | Least connections | 5% traffic |
      | Notification service | Request rate | 30% error rate | 5 retries, jittered | Weighted random | 20% traffic |

      | Analytics service | Batch size | 10% timeout rate | No retry | Queue-based | 25% traffic |
    Then service mesh should manage traffic intelligently
    And scaling should be service-specific
    And failures should be handled gracefully
    And deployments should be safe

      | Compute instances | Spot instances when possible | Maintain 99.9% uptime | Use 70% spot, 30% on-demand | Gradual spot replacement | Cost per request |
      | Reserved capacity | 1-year commitments | Base load coverage | Cover 60% average load | RI utilization >85% | RI coverage |
      | Burstable instances | T-series for light loads | CPU credits available | Dev/test environments | Baseline performance | Credit balance |
      | Storage scaling | Lifecycle policies | Hot data performance | Archive after 90 days | Intelligent tiering | Storage cost/GB |
