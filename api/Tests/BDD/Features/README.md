## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific feature
npm test -- features/auth/authentication.feature

# Run by tag
npm test -- --tags @auth
npm test -- --tags @not-implemented

# Generate test report
npm run test:report
```

## Implementation Status

All endpoints are currently marked with `@not-implemented` tag. As endpoints are implemented:
1. Remove the `@not-implemented` tag
2. Update the endpoint implementation in the API
3. Ensure tests pass
4. Update coverage metrics

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Create feature file in appropriate directory
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Include all positive and negative scenarios
4. Tag appropriately (@endpoint, @category, @not-implemented)
5. Update this README with new scenarios

## Notes

- Each feature file corresponds to a functional area from CLAUDE.md
- Scenarios cover happy paths, error cases, validation, and edge cases
- All data is properly encrypted and HIPAA/FERPA compliant
- Performance requirements (<2s response time) are tested
- Security scenarios included for sensitive operations
