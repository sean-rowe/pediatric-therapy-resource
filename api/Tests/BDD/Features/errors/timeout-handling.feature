Feature: Timeout Handling and Request Management
  As a platform user and administrator
  I want intelligent timeout handling and request management
  So that system responsiveness is maintained and resources are efficiently utilized

  Background:
    Given timeout management systems are configured
    And request monitoring is active
    And timeout policies are established
    And retry mechanisms are implemented
    And resource management is operational

  # Core Timeout Management
  @errors @timeout-handling @timeout-policies @request-management @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement comprehensive timeout policies for different request types
    Given different request types have different timeout requirements
    And timeout policies prevent resource exhaustion and improve user experience
    When implementing timeout policies:
      | Request Type | Default Timeout | Maximum Timeout | Timeout Strategy | Retry Policy | User Notification |
      | Authentication | 30 seconds | 60 seconds | Fixed timeout | 3 retries with backoff | Auth timeout notice |
      | File uploads | 300 seconds | 600 seconds | Progressive timeout | 2 retries | Upload progress timeout |
      | Database queries | 30 seconds | 120 seconds | Query-based timeout | 1 retry | Query timeout alert |
      | API calls | 60 seconds | 180 seconds | Service-based timeout | 3 retries with circuit breaker | API timeout notice |
      | Report generation | 600 seconds | 1800 seconds | Complexity-based timeout | No retries | Report timeout notice |
      | Search operations | 10 seconds | 30 seconds | Search-optimized timeout | 2 retries | Search timeout notice |
    Then timeouts should be appropriate for request complexity
    And strategies should optimize for request characteristics
    And retry policies should prevent cascading failures
    And notifications should inform users appropriately

  @errors @timeout-handling @adaptive-timeouts @dynamic-adjustment @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement adaptive timeouts based on system load and performance
    Given system performance varies with load and conditions
    And adaptive timeouts optimize for current system state
    When implementing adaptive timeouts:
      | System Condition | Timeout Adjustment | Adjustment Algorithm | Performance Monitoring | Adaptation Speed | User Impact |
      | Low load | Reduced timeouts | 20% reduction | Response time tracking | Immediate | Faster responses |
      | Normal load | Standard timeouts | Baseline values | Load monitoring | Gradual | Standard responses |
      | High load | Increased timeouts | 50% increase | Resource monitoring | Responsive | Delayed responses |
      | Peak load | Extended timeouts | 100% increase | Capacity monitoring | Rapid | Extended responses |
      | System stress | Maximum timeouts | 200% increase | Stress monitoring | Immediate | Maximum patience |
      | Recovery phase | Gradual reduction | Step-down algorithm | Recovery monitoring | Controlled | Improving responses |
    Then adjustments should be proportional to system state

      | Priority Level | Timeout Multiplier | Queue Position | Resource Allocation | Preemption Rights | Recovery Priority |
      | Emergency | 3x standard timeout | Front of queue | Dedicated resources | Can preempt others | Highest recovery |
      | High priority | 2x standard timeout | Priority queue | Enhanced resources | Limited preemption | High recovery |
      | Standard priority | 1x standard timeout | Standard queue | Standard resources | No preemption | Standard recovery |
      | Low priority | 0.8x standard timeout | Background queue | Shared resources | Can be preempted | Low recovery |
      | Batch priority | 0.5x standard timeout | Batch queue | Batch resources | Background processing | Batch recovery |
      | Guest user | 0.6x standard timeout | Guest queue | Limited resources | Lowest priority | Basic recovery |
    Then priority should determine timeout allowances
    And resource allocation should match priority
    And preemption should be used judiciously
    And recovery should prioritize appropriately

      | Initial timeout | Standard duration | "Processing..." | Continue processing | Standard cancel | Progress bar |
      | Extended timeout | 2x initial | "Taking longer than expected" | Continue with monitoring | Easy cancel | Detailed progress |
      | Long timeout | 3x initial | "Complex operation in progress" | Continue with alerts | Prominent cancel | Step-by-step progress |
      | Maximum timeout | 5x initial | "Maximum processing time" | Final attempt | Forced completion | Completion estimate |
      | Timeout exceeded | Operation limit | "Operation timed out" | Graceful termination | Retry option | Failure explanation |
      | Manual override | Admin extension | "Administrator extended timeout" | Supervised continuation | Admin cancel | Admin monitoring |
    Then stages should provide increasing patience
    And communication should set appropriate expectations
    And cancellation should always be available
    And progress should be clearly indicated
