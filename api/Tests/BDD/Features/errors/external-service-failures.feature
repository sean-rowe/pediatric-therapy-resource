  As a platform administrator and user
  I want robust handling of external service failures
  So that system functionality is maintained despite third-party service issues

  Background:
    Given external service monitoring is active
    And fallback mechanisms are implemented
    And service health checks are configured
    And circuit breaker patterns are deployed
    And error handling workflows are established

  # Core External Service Management
  @errors @external-service-failures @service-monitoring @health-checks @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Monitor external service health and detect failures
    Given external services are critical to platform functionality
    And early failure detection enables rapid response
    When monitoring external service health:
      | Service Type | Health Check Method | Check Frequency | Failure Threshold | Alert Mechanism | Recovery Monitoring |
      | Payment services | API health endpoint | 30 seconds | 3 consecutive failures | Immediate alert | Payment monitoring |

    And alerts should reach responsible personnel
    And recovery should be automatically monitored

  @errors @external-service-failures @circuit-breaker @failure-isolation @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Implement circuit breaker patterns to isolate failing services
    Given circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
    And service isolation maintains system stability
    When implementing circuit breaker patterns:
