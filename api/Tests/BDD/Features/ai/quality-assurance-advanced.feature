  As a quality assurance manager
  I want comprehensive quality validation with 98% accuracy standards
  So that all therapy materials meet the highest clinical standards

  Background:
    Given quality assurance system is configured
    And 98% accuracy requirement is enforced
    And multi-layer validation is active
    And automated quality metrics are tracked
    And clinical standards are continuously updated

  # Core Quality Assurance Workflows
  @ai @quality-assurance @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate content meets 98% accuracy requirement
    Given generated content requires quality validation
    And accuracy standards are set to 98% minimum
    When content undergoes quality assessment:
      | Content Type            | Accuracy Metric       | Current Score | Target Score | Validation Method     | Remediation Action   |
      | Educational worksheets  | Text accuracy         | 99.2%         | 98%         | Spell/grammar check   | Pass directly        |
      | Clinical instructions   | Medical accuracy      | 97.5%         | 98%         | Expert validation     | Enhance and re-test  |
      | Assessment tools        | Scoring accuracy      | 99.8%         | 98%         | Algorithm validation  | Pass with monitoring |
      | Therapy protocols       | Protocol compliance   | 96.9%         | 98%         | Standards check       | Major revision       |

    Then accuracy should be measured precisely
    And content below 98% should be flagged for improvement
    And remediation should bring content to standard
    And only compliant content should be approved for use

  @ai @quality-assurance @multi-layer @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Multi-layer quality validation system
    Given quality requires multiple validation layers
    And each layer has specific focus areas
    When implementing multi-layer validation:
