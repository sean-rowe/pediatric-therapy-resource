Feature: AI Generation Cost Control and Credit Management
  As a platform administrator
  I want to control AI generation costs with daily limits and credit systems
  So that we maintain sustainable operations while providing value to users

  Background:
    Given AI cost control system is configured
    And daily generation limits are enforced
    And credit management system is active
    And usage tracking is real-time
    And cost optimization strategies are implemented

  # Core Cost Control Workflows
  @ai @cost-control @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce 10 generations per day limit for standard users
    Given I am a standard subscription user
    And daily generation limit is set to 10
    When I track my generation usage throughout the day:
      | Time     | Generation Request      | Type              | Credits Used | Daily Total | Status            | Remaining |
      | 08:00 AM | Fine motor worksheet    | Standard          | 1           | 1          | Approved          | 9         |
      | 09:15 AM | Visual schedule         | Standard          | 1           | 2          | Approved          | 8         |
      | 10:30 AM | Social story           | Complex           | 2           | 4          | Approved          | 6         |
      | 11:00 AM | Assessment tools       | Standard          | 1           | 5          | Approved          | 5         |
      | 01:00 PM | Communication board    | Complex           | 2           | 7          | Approved          | 3         |
      | 02:30 PM | Exercise cards         | Standard          | 1           | 8          | Approved          | 2         |
      | 03:45 PM | Token economy board    | Standard          | 1           | 9          | Approved          | 1         |
      | 04:00 PM | Data collection sheet  | Standard          | 1           | 10         | Approved - Limit  | 0         |
      | 04:30 PM | Handwriting practice   | Standard          | 1           | 11         | Denied - Limit    | 0         |
      | 05:00 PM | Coloring page          | Standard          | 1           | 11         | Purchase Option   | 0         |
    Then generation should be allowed up to daily limit
    And excess requests should be denied with clear messaging
    And purchase options should be presented when limit reached
    And usage should reset at midnight user timezone

  @ai @cost-control @credit-system @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Credit-based generation management for flexible usage
    Given credit system allows purchase of additional generations
    And different generation types consume different credits
    When managing credits across generation types:
      | Generation Type         | Base Credits | Complexity Multiplier | Rush Processing | Total Credits | Monthly Cap |
      | Simple worksheet        | 1            | 1.0x                 | +0            | 1             | Unlimited   |
      | Complex curriculum      | 3            | 1.5x                 | +2            | 7             | 50          |
      | Personalized content    | 2            | 2.0x                 | +1            | 5             | 100         |
      | Batch generation (10)   | 8            | 1.2x                 | +5            | 15            | 20          |
      | Clinical assessment     | 4            | 1.0x                 | +0            | 4             | 75          |
      | Multi-language set      | 5            | 1.8x                 | +3            | 12            | 30          |
    Then credit consumption should be transparent
    And users should see credit balance before generation
    And complex requests should consume appropriate credits
    And monthly caps should prevent excessive usage

  @ai @cost-control @subscription-tiers @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Different subscription tiers with varied generation limits
    Given multiple subscription tiers exist with different benefits
    When comparing generation allowances by tier:
      | Subscription Tier | Daily Generations | Bonus Credits/Month | Credit Price | Priority Queue | Batch Processing | Advanced Features |
      | Free Trial        | 3                | 0                   | N/A          | No            | No              | Limited          |
      | Basic             | 10               | 5                   | $0.50        | No            | No              | Standard         |
      | Professional      | 25               | 20                  | $0.40        | Yes           | Yes (5)         | Full             |
      | Team              | 50               | 50                  | $0.30        | Yes           | Yes (10)        | Full + Analytics |
      | Enterprise        | Unlimited        | Custom              | $0.20        | Priority      | Unlimited       | Full + Custom    |
      | Educational       | 100              | 100                 | $0.25        | Yes           | Yes (20)        | Full + Bulk      |
    Then tier benefits should be clearly differentiated
    And upgrades should provide immediate access to benefits
    And credit pricing should reward higher tiers
    And enterprise needs should be accommodated

  @ai @cost-control @usage-analytics @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Comprehensive usage analytics and cost tracking
    Given administrators need visibility into AI costs
    And usage patterns inform optimization strategies
    When analyzing AI generation costs:
      | Metric Category    | Tracking Detail        | Frequency    | Alert Threshold | Optimization Action | Expected Savings |
      | API costs          | Per-provider breakdown | Real-time    | $500/day       | Model switching     | 20% reduction   |
      | User patterns      | Peak usage times       | Hourly       | 80% capacity   | Load balancing      | 15% efficiency  |
      | Generation types   | Cost by content type   | Daily        | $50/type/day   | Template suggestions| 25% reduction   |
      | Failed attempts    | Retry cost impact      | Real-time    | 10% failure    | Prompt improvement  | 30% less retry  |
      | Batch efficiency   | Batch vs individual    | Weekly       | <2x savings    | Batch promotion     | 40% for batches |
      | Model performance  | Quality/cost ratio     | Monthly      | <0.8 ratio     | Model evaluation    | 15% better ROI  |
    Then cost analytics should provide actionable insights
    And optimization opportunities should be identified
    And cost reduction strategies should be implemented
    And ROI should be continuously improved

  # Advanced Cost Control Features
  @ai @cost-control @dynamic-pricing @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Dynamic pricing based on demand and resource availability
    Given system resources have variable availability
    And pricing can adjust to manage demand
    When implementing dynamic pricing:
      | Time Period        | Demand Level | Base Price | Surge Multiplier | Queue Time | Final Price | User Notice    |
      | Midnight-6 AM      | Low          | $0.40      | 0.8x            | <30 sec    | $0.32       | Off-peak rate  |
      | 6 AM-9 AM         | Medium       | $0.40      | 1.0x            | <2 min     | $0.40       | Standard rate  |
      | 9 AM-12 PM        | High         | $0.40      | 1.3x            | <5 min     | $0.52       | Peak pricing   |
      | 12 PM-2 PM        | Medium       | $0.40      | 1.0x            | <2 min     | $0.40       | Standard rate  |
      | 2 PM-5 PM         | Very High    | $0.40      | 1.5x            | <10 min    | $0.60       | High demand    |
      | 5 PM-Midnight     | Low-Medium   | $0.40      | 0.9x            | <1 min     | $0.36       | Evening rate   |
    Then pricing should reflect resource availability
    And users should see current pricing before generation
    And surge pricing should be capped at reasonable levels
    And off-peak usage should be incentivized

  @ai @cost-control @bulk-packages @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Bulk credit packages and volume discounts
    Given users can purchase credits in bulk for savings
    When offering credit packages:
