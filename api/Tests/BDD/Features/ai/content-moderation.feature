  I want to ensure all AI-generated content is safe and appropriate
  So that therapy materials meet clinical standards and protect users

  Background:
    Given content moderation system is configured
    And multi-layer safety checks are active
    And clinical appropriateness standards are defined
    And real-time content filtering is enabled
    And moderation feedback loops are established

  # Core Content Moderation Workflows
  @ai @content-moderation @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Multi-layer content safety validation
    Given content requires comprehensive safety checks
    And multiple validation layers are configured
    When content undergoes moderation:
      | Content Type         | Safety Checks          | Clinical Checks        | Age Appropriateness | Cultural Sensitivity | Final Score | Status    |
      | Visual worksheet     | Violence, explicit     | Therapeutic value      | 5-7 years match    | Inclusive imagery   | 98%        | Approved  |
      | Social story         | Emotional triggers     | Evidence-based         | 8-10 years match   | Diverse representation | 95%     | Approved  |
      | Exercise cards       | Physical safety        | Proper technique       | Motor development  | Accessibility       | 97%        | Approved  |

    Then all safety layers should be evaluated
    And clinical standards should be verified
    And age appropriateness should be confirmed
    And content scoring should guide decisions
    And only safe content should be approved

  @ai @content-moderation @clinical-standards @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Clinical appropriateness validation for therapy materials
    Given therapy materials must meet clinical standards
    And evidence-based practices guide validation
    When validating clinical appropriateness:
