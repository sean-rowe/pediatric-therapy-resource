Feature: AI Quality Assurance
  As a clinical reviewer or system administrator
  I want to validate AI-generated therapy content for clinical appropriateness and accuracy
  So that only safe, evidence-based materials are available to therapists

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a clinical reviewer
    And the AI quality assurance system is active
    And there are AI-generated materials awaiting review

  @ai-safety @automated-validation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Automated safety validation catches inappropriate content
    Given an AI-generated worksheet contains the word "dangerous"
    When the automated safety validation runs
    Then the content should be flagged for manual review
    And the flag reason should be "Safety concern: potentially dangerous content"
    And the resource should not be available to therapists
    And a notification should be sent to clinical reviewers

  @clinical-accuracy @manual-review @not-implemented
  Scenario: Clinical reviewer approves AI-generated content
    Given I have an AI-generated "Fine Motor Skills Worksheet" awaiting review
    And the worksheet targets ages 4-6 years
    When I access the review queue
    Then I should see the worksheet details:
      | Field              | Value                           |
      | Resource Type      | Fine Motor Skills Worksheet    |
      | Target Age         | 4-6 years                      |
      | Generation Model   | GPT-4 + Stable Diffusion XL   |
      | Safety Score       | 98% (Passed automated checks) |
      | Clinical Areas     | Fine motor, bilateral coordination |
    When I review the content for clinical appropriateness
    And I verify the exercises are age-appropriate
    And I confirm the instructions are clear and safe
    And I mark the content as "Approved"
    Then the resource should be added to the public library
    And the generating therapist should be notified
    And the approval should be logged in the audit trail

  @quality-rejection @feedback-loop @not-implemented
  Scenario: Clinical reviewer rejects AI content with feedback
    Given I am reviewing an AI-generated "Sensory Diet Schedule"
    When I identify issues with the content:
      | Issue Type         | Description                    |
      | Age inappropriate  | Activities too advanced for 3-year-olds |
      | Safety concern     | Trampoline activity without supervision notes |
      | Clinical accuracy  | Incorrect sensory processing terminology |
    And I reject the content with detailed feedback
    Then the content should be removed from review queue
    And the generating therapist should receive feedback
    And the AI system should learn from the rejection
    And similar content should be flagged in future generations

  @spelling-accuracy @automated-checks @not-implemented
  Scenario: Automated spelling and grammar validation
    Given an AI-generated resource contains text
    When the automated text validation runs
    Then all words should be checked against medical and educational dictionaries
    And any misspellings should be automatically flagged
    And grammar should be validated for clarity
    And the accuracy score should be calculated
    When I find a spelling error like "therapee" instead of "therapy"
    Then the content should be automatically rejected
    And the error should be logged for AI model improvement

  @evidence-based @protocol-validation @not-implemented
  Scenario: Validate AI content against evidence-based protocols
    Given an AI-generated "Apraxia Therapy Protocol" is submitted
    When the protocol validation system runs
    Then the content should be checked against:
      | Validation Source    | Requirement                    |
      | ASHA guidelines      | Meets speech therapy standards |
      | Peer-reviewed studies| References current research    |
      | Clinical protocols   | Aligns with established methods|
      | Safety standards     | No contraindicated techniques  |
    And the evidence level should be calculated (1-5 scale)
    And if evidence level is below 3, content should require expert review

  @first-time-review @novel-activities @not-implemented
  Scenario: First-time activity type requires enhanced review
    Given an AI generates a new type of activity "Virtual Reality Balance Training"
    And this activity type has never been reviewed before
    When the content enters the review queue
    Then it should be flagged as "Novel Activity Type"
    And it should require review by the Clinical Advisory Board
    And the review process should include:
      | Review Step        | Requirement                    |
      | Literature review  | Check for supporting research  |
      | Safety assessment  | Evaluate potential risks       |
      | Equipment needs    | Verify accessibility           |
      | Training requirements| Assess therapist preparation |
    And approval should require consensus from 3+ board members

  @accuracy-requirements @quality-thresholds @not-implemented
  Scenario: Enforce 98% accuracy requirement for educational content
    Given the system measures content accuracy across categories:
      | Category           | Current Score | Threshold |
      | Spelling/Grammar   | 97.2%        | 98%       |
      | Clinical accuracy  | 99.1%        | 98%       |
      | Age appropriateness| 98.8%        | 98%       |
      | Safety compliance  | 99.9%        | 98%       |
    When the overall accuracy falls below 98%
    Then new AI generations should be temporarily paused
    And the AI model should undergo retraining
    And clinical reviewers should be notified
    And a quality improvement plan should be initiated

  @reviewer-workload @queue-management @not-implemented
  Scenario: Manage clinical reviewer workload efficiently
    Given there are 50 items in the review queue
    And I am a clinical reviewer with SLP specialization
    When I access my review dashboard
    Then I should see items prioritized by:
      | Priority Factor    | Weight | Example                      |
      | Safety flags       | High   | Content with safety concerns |
      | My specialization  | Medium | SLP-related materials        |
      | Generation urgency | Medium | Requested by premium users   |
      | Content complexity | Low    | Simple worksheets last       |
    And my daily workload should be capped at 15 reviews
    And items should be auto-assigned based on expertise

  @quality-metrics @continuous-improvement @not-implemented
  Scenario: Track and improve AI content quality over time
    Given the system tracks quality metrics over the past 3 months
    When I view the quality dashboard
    Then I should see trends for:
      | Metric                 | Current | 3-Month Trend |
      | Approval rate          | 87%     | +5%          |
      | Average review time    | 12 min  | -2 min       |
      | Safety flag rate       | 3%      | -1%          |
      | Therapist satisfaction | 4.6/5   | +0.3         |
    And I should see improvement recommendations
    And the AI model should automatically incorporate learnings
    And quality thresholds should adjust based on performance

  @batch-review @efficiency @not-implemented
  Scenario: Process multiple similar items efficiently
    Given I have 8 similar "Handwriting Practice" worksheets in review
    When I select batch review mode
    Then I should be able to:
      | Action               | Result                         |
      | Review one thoroughly| Mark as template for others    |
      | Apply bulk decisions | Approve/reject similar items   |
      | Add batch comments   | Apply same feedback to all     |
      | Set review precedent | Auto-approve future similar items |
    And the review time should be reduced by 70%
    And consistency should be maintained across similar items

  @user-feedback @post-publication @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle user feedback on published AI content
    Given an AI-generated resource has been published for 2 weeks
    And therapists are providing feedback through the rating system
    When the resource receives concerning feedback:
      | Feedback Type      | Comment                        | Impact |
      | Safety concern     | "Activity caused student injury"| High   |
      | Clinical accuracy  | "Technique is outdated"        | Medium |
      | Usability issue    | "Instructions unclear"         | Low    |
    Then high-impact feedback should trigger immediate re-review
    And the resource should be temporarily removed if necessary
    And the clinical team should investigate and respond
    And improvements should be made based on user feedback
