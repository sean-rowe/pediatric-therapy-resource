Feature: Automated Clinical Review Pipeline for AI-Generated Content
  As a clinical quality manager
  I want an automated clinical review pipeline for AI-generated content
  So that all therapy materials meet evidence-based clinical standards

  Background:
    Given clinical review pipeline is configured
    And evidence-based criteria are loaded
    And clinical expert systems are active
    And review automation workflows are enabled
    And quality assurance protocols are enforced

  # Core Clinical Review Workflows
  @ai @clinical-review @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Automated clinical review of therapy materials
    Given AI-generated content requires clinical validation
    And review criteria are based on therapy best practices
    When content undergoes automated clinical review:
      | Content Type            | Clinical Aspects        | Review Criteria         | Pass Threshold     | Expert Validation   |
      | Speech therapy cards    | Articulation accuracy   | Phonetic correctness    | 100% accurate      | SLP verification    |
      | OT exercise sheets      | Movement safety         | Biomechanical safety    | No unsafe elements | OT verification     |
      | PT activity guides      | Physical appropriateness| Age-appropriate ROM     | Within safe limits | PT verification     |
      | ABA behavior charts     | Behavioral principles   | Evidence-based methods  | ABA compliant      | BCBA verification   |
      | Cognitive worksheets    | Developmental level     | Cognitive milestones    | Age-appropriate    | Psych verification  |
      | Social skills materials | Social appropriateness  | Cultural sensitivity    | Inclusive content  | Clinical review     |
    Then automated review should identify all clinical issues
    And content should be scored against evidence-based criteria
    And expert validation should be triggered when needed
    And only clinically sound content should be approved

  @ai @clinical-review @evidence-based @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Evidence-based practice validation
    Given clinical review uses current research evidence
    And evidence databases are continuously updated
    When validating against evidence-based practices:
      | Practice Area           | Evidence Source         | Validation Method       | Currency Requirement| Update Frequency    |
      | Articulation therapy    | ASHA guidelines        | Technique validation    | <2 years old       | Quarterly          |

      | Assistive technology    | RESNA standards        | Tech appropriateness    | Current standards  | As published       |
    Then validation should use most current evidence
    And outdated practices should be flagged
    And evidence-based modifications should be suggested
    And compliance with professional standards should be verified

  @ai @clinical-review @multi-stage @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Multi-stage clinical review process
    Given complex content requires thorough review

    Then each stage should thoroughly evaluate content
    And progression should depend on passing previous stages
    And manual review should be triggered appropriately
    And final approval should ensure comprehensive quality

  @ai @clinical-review @specialist-routing @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Specialist routing for domain-specific review
    Given different therapy domains require specialist review
    And routing logic identifies content specialization
    When content is routed to appropriate specialists:
      | Content Domain          | Specialist Type         | Routing Criteria        | Review Focus         | Response Time      |
      | Feeding therapy         | SLP with feeding cert   | Feeding content detected| Safety and techniques| <4 hours          |
      | Sensory processing      | OT with SI cert         | Sensory content present | SI principles        | <6 hours          |
      | Gait training           | PT with neuro specialty | Gait patterns included  | Biomechanics         | <4 hours          |

      | Behavior management     | BCBA certified          | Behavior plans included | ABA principles       | <6 hours          |
      | Assistive technology    | ATP certified           | AT recommendations      | Device appropriateness| <12 hours         |
    Then routing should accurately identify specialization needs
    And appropriate specialists should be assigned
    And review should focus on domain-specific criteria
    And specialist feedback should be incorporated
