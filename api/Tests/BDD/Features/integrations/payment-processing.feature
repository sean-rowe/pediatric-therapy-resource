Feature: Comprehensive Payment Processing Integration Testing
  As a platform administrator and marketplace user
  I want seamless integration with payment processing systems
  So that subscription billing and marketplace transactions work reliably

  Background:
    Given payment processing integration is configured
    And Stripe Connect is enabled for marketplace transactions
    And PayPal is configured as alternative payment method
    And tax calculation service is integrated
    And PCI DSS Level 1 compliance is maintained

  # Core Payment Processing Workflows
  @integration @payment @stripe-connect @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Complete Stripe Connect marketplace integration
    Given Stripe Connect is configured for marketplace sellers
    And platform uses 70/30 revenue split model
    When marketplace payment processing is tested:
      | Transaction Type    | Amount  | Platform Fee | Seller Amount | Processing Time | Tax Handling    |
      | Digital resource    | $24.99  | $7.50       | $17.49       | <3 seconds     | Automatic       |

      | Refund processing   | -$24.99 | -$7.50      | -$17.49      | <10 seconds    | Tax adjustment  |
    Then all payment transactions should complete successfully
    And revenue splits should be calculated accurately
    And funds should be transferred to correct accounts
    And tax calculations should be compliant with jurisdictions

  @integration @payment @subscription-billing @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Subscription billing lifecycle management
    Given subscription billing is configured with Stripe

      | Failed payment      | Payment decline      | Retry attempts         | Multiple attempts  | Dunning emails  |
      | Reactivation        | After cancellation   | New billing cycle      | Fresh payment      | Reactivation email|
    Then subscription states should be managed correctly
    And billing should be accurate and timely
