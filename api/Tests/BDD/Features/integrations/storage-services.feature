Feature: Comprehensive Storage Services Integration Testing
  As a platform administrator and content manager
  I want seamless integration with cloud storage and file processing services
  So that file storage, optimization, and delivery work reliably at scale

  Background:
    Given storage services integration is configured
    And AWS S3 is connected for primary file storage
    And Cloudinary is configured for image and video optimization
    And file processing pipelines are active
    And storage security and compliance are maintained

  # Core Storage Service Integrations
  @integration @storage @aws-s3 @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: AWS S3 integration for scalable file storage
    Given AWS S3 is configured with proper IAM roles and policies
    And S3 bucket structure is optimized for therapy content
    When AWS S3 integration is tested across storage scenarios:
      | Storage Type            | File Categories         | Access Patterns       | Security Level        | Performance Target    |
      | Therapy resources       | PDFs, images, videos    | Frequent read access  | Encrypted at rest     | <500ms retrieval     |
      | User-generated content  | Uploads, recordings     | Write-heavy           | User-scoped access    | <2s upload           |
      | Assessment data         | Forms, results          | Occasional access     | HIPAA compliant       | <1s retrieval        |
      | Backup archives         | System backups          | Rare access           | Multi-region          | <10s retrieval       |

      | Static assets           | CSS, JS, fonts          | High-frequency read   | Public CDN cached     | <50ms global         |
    Then AWS S3 should handle all storage types efficiently
    And access patterns should be optimized for each use case
    And security requirements should be enforced consistently
    And performance targets should be met across all scenarios

  @integration @storage @cloudinary @high @not-implemented

      | Marketing assets        | Brand overlay, resize   | Maximum quality 100%  | Multiple formats      | <5 seconds           |
    Then Cloudinary should optimize all media types effectively
    And transformations should maintain appropriate quality
    And delivery formats should be browser-optimized
    And processing should complete within target timeframes

  @integration @storage @file-processing @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: File processing pipeline integration

    And output formats should meet platform requirements
    And quality assurance should maintain clinical standards

  @integration @storage @access-control @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Storage access control and permissions management

      | Content Creator         | Upload/manage content   | Own creations         | Create, update, delete| Creation tracking     |
      | Guest User              | Read public resources   | Public materials      | View only             | Anonymous logging     |
    Then access permissions should be enforced correctly
    And role-based restrictions should prevent unauthorized access
    And operation limits should be respected
    And audit trails should capture all access patterns
