Feature: Comprehensive Communication Services Integration Testing
  As a platform administrator and user
  I want seamless integration with communication platforms
  So that SMS, email, and support communications work reliably

  Background:
    Given communication services integration is configured
    And Twilio is connected for SMS and voice communications
    And SendGrid is configured for transactional email delivery
    And Intercom is integrated for customer support
    And communication compliance is maintained

  # Core Communication Service Integrations
  @integration @communication @twilio @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: Twilio integration for SMS and voice communications
    Given Twilio API is authenticated and configured
    And SMS messaging is optimized for therapy platform use

    Then SendGrid should deliver emails with high reliability
    And open rates should meet engagement targets
    And bounce rates should remain within acceptable limits
    And email reputation should be maintained

  @integration @communication @intercom @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Intercom integration for customer support and engagement
    Given Intercom is configured for multi-channel support
    And support workflows are optimized for therapy platform

    And resolution rates should exceed minimum thresholds
    And customer satisfaction should remain high

  @integration @communication @multi-channel @medium @not-implemented
  Scenario: Multi-channel communication orchestration
    Given multiple communication channels are integrated
    And message routing is optimized for user preferences

    And success metrics should meet targets

  # Communication Performance and Reliability
  @integration @communication @performance @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Communication service performance and scalability
    Given communication services must handle high volumes
    And performance targets must be maintained under load
    When communication performance is tested:
      | Volume Scenario         | Messages per Hour       | Processing Latency    | Delivery Success Rate | Error Rate Tolerance  |
      | Normal operations       | 10,000 messages        | <30 seconds          | >99%                  | <0.5%                |
      | Peak usage periods      | 50,000 messages        | <2 minutes           | >98.5%                | <1%                  |

    Then communication services should scale to handle peak loads
    And processing latency should remain within targets
    And delivery success rates should meet requirements
    And error rates should stay within acceptable bounds

  @integration @communication @monitoring @high @not-implemented
  Scenario: Communication service monitoring and alerting
    Given communication services require continuous monitoring
    When communication monitoring is tested:

      | Excessive frequency     | Send frequency limits   | Delay messaging       | Frequency notice      | Smart scheduling      |
    Then compliance violations should be detected automatically
    And response should protect users and platform
    And prevention should reduce future violations
    And user impact should be minimized

  @integration @communication @error @user-preferences @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle user communication preference conflicts
    Given users have complex communication preferences
    When preference conflict scenarios are tested:
      | Preference Conflict     | Conflict Type           | Resolution Strategy   | User Control          | Default Behavior      |
      | Channel preferences     | Email vs SMS preference | Honor most recent     | User settings page    | Platform default      |

      | Do not disturb periods  | Critical vs non-critical| Respect for non-critical| DND schedule         | Honor DND always      |
    Then preference conflicts should be resolved consistently
    And user control should be maintained
    And defaults should be user-friendly
    And preferences should be easy to manage

  @integration @communication @error @high-volume @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle high-volume communication processing loads
    Given communication systems may be overwhelmed by volume
    When high-volume scenarios are tested:
      | Volume Scenario         | Load Characteristics    | Processing Strategy   | User Experience       | System Protection     |
