  As a therapy professional
  I want seamless integration with Electronic Health Record systems
  So that I can efficiently document therapy sessions and sync patient data

  Background:
    Given EHR integration is configured and active
    And supported EHR systems include SimplePractice, WebPT, and TheraNest
    And OAuth 2.0 authentication is implemented for secure connections
    And bi-directional data sync is enabled

      | Billing documentation  | WebPT billing           | Session billing data    | UPTRMS to EHR      |
    Then WebPT integration should maintain data consistency
    And exercise prescriptions should sync with resource library
    And progress tracking should be unified across systems
    And billing information should be accurately transferred

  @integration @ehr @theranest @critical @not-implemented
  Scenario: TheraNest mental health therapy integration
    Given I am connected to TheraNest EHR system
    And TheraNest API access is properly configured

      | Business rule conflicts| EHR validation fails  | Show validation error | User corrects data |
      | Version conflicts     | Record versions differ | Three-way merge       | User chooses version|
    Then data conflicts should be resolved systematically
    And resolution should preserve data integrity
    And users should be involved only when necessary
    And conflict resolution should be auditable

  @integration @ehr @error @system-incompatibility @not-implemented
  Scenario: Handle EHR system incompatibilities and limitations
    Given different EHR systems have varying capabilities
    When system incompatibility scenarios are tested:

      | DNS resolution failure| Cannot reach EHR     | Alternative endpoints | Failover to backup |
      | SSL certificate issues| Security warnings    | Certificate validation| Secure connections |
    Then connectivity issues should be handled transparently
    And data should never be lost due to connectivity problems
    And users should receive appropriate feedback about connection status
    And system should automatically resume operations when connectivity returns
