Feature: Batch and Async Operations API Endpoints
  As a platform user
  I want to perform batch and asynchronous operations
  So that I can efficiently process large amounts of data

  Background:
    Given the API is available
    And I am authenticated as "therapist@clinic.com"

  # POST /api/batch/resources/upload
  @endpoint @batch @upload @not-implemented
  Scenario: Batch upload resources
    When I send a POST request to "/api/batch/resources/upload" with:
      | field         | value                         |
      | resources     | array of 50 resource files    |

    Given batch operation "batch-123" is processing
    When I send a GET request to "/api/batch/batch-123/status"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should contain:
      | field         | type   |
      | status        | string |
      | processed     | number |
      | failed        | number |

    And validation results should be available

  # POST /api/batch/sessions/create
  @endpoint @batch @sessions @not-implemented
  Scenario: Create recurring sessions in batch
