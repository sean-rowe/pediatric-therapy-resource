  # FR-032 Missing Critical Outcome Measurement Business Workflow Scenarios
  @foto-integration @functional-outcomes @insurance-reporting @workflow @not-implemented
  Scenario: Complete FOTO assessment administration and outcome tracking for insurance requirements
    Given I am treating patient "Robert Davis" for shoulder impingement
    And insurance requires FOTO outcome reporting for continued authorization
    When I initiate comprehensive FOTO assessment at intake
    And I gather required assessment information:
      | Assessment Element   | Details                         |
      | Primary diagnosis    | M75.30 - Calcific tendinitis  |
      | Body region          | Shoulder                       |
      | Surgery history      | None                           |
      | Visit type           | Initial evaluation             |
      | Risk factors         | Age 52, diabetic               |
    Then the FOTO system should present adaptive questions:
      | Question Category    | Example Questions               |
      | Pain level           | 0-10 scale with body diagram    |
      | Functional activities| Reaching overhead, lifting      |
      | Work impact          | Job-specific task limitations   |
      | Quality of life      | Sleep, recreation restrictions  |
    When Robert completes the initial assessment
    Then the system should calculate comprehensive scores:
      | Score Type           | Robert's Results | National Average |
      | Functional Status    | 45               | 55 for similar dx|
      | Pain level           | 7/10             | 6/10 for similar |
      | Predicted visits     | 12 sessions      | 8-14 range       |
      | Risk adjustment      | Applied for diabetes| Standard modifier|
    And outcome tracking should provide:
      | Tracking Element     | Implementation                  |
      | Baseline establishment| Initial scores documented      |
      | Progress benchmarks  | Expected improvement milestones|
      | Discharge prediction | Data-driven visit estimate     |
      | Insurance reporting  | Real-time outcome data         |
    When I conduct reassessment after 6 sessions
    Then progress analysis should show:
      | Progress Metric      | Results                         |
      | Functional improvement| 55 (10-point gain)             |
      | Pain reduction       | 4/10 (3-point improvement)     |
      | Goal achievement     | 60% of functional targets met   |
      | Discharge readiness  | 6 more sessions predicted       |
    And insurance reporting should demonstrate:
      | Insurance Requirement| Evidence Provided               |
      | Medical necessity    | Functional limitations documented|
      | Measurable progress  | 22% functional score improvement|
      | Skilled intervention | Complex shoulder rehabilitation |

  @copm-administration @client-centered-outcomes @occupational-performance @workflow @not-implemented
  Scenario: Administer Canadian Occupational Performance Measure for client-centered evaluation
    Given I am evaluating "Linda Thompson" who has multiple sclerosis
    And I need client-centered outcome measurement
    When I begin comprehensive COPM interview
    And I guide Linda through systematic identification process:
      | COPM Step            | Process                         |
      | Problem identification| Daily activities causing difficulty |

      | Leisure gardening    | 7          | 6           | 5            |
    And COPM scoring should calculate:
      | COMP Score Type      | Calculation                     | Linda's Scores |
      | Total Performance    | Average of 5 performance ratings| 4.0           |
      | Total Satisfaction   | Average of 5 satisfaction ratings| 3.0          |
      | Weighted scores      | Importance Ã— performance ratings| Used for goals |
    When developing intervention priorities
    Then COMP results should guide:
      | Intervention Planning| Priority Focus                  |
      | Goal development     | Driving safety (highest importance)|
      | Service planning     | Meal prep and work tasks        |
      | Outcome tracking     | Performance and satisfaction    |
      | Client engagement    | Client-chosen meaningful activities|
    And reassessment protocol should include:
      | Reassessment Element | Implementation                  |
      | Same problem areas   | Re-rate performance and satisfaction|
      | Change calculation   | Difference scores from baseline |
      | Clinical significance| Minimum 2-point change considered meaningful|
      | Client priorities    | Opportunity to adjust focus areas|

      | Patient satisfaction | 4.6/5          | 4.4/5          | 4.0/5      |
    When I analyze outcomes by diagnosis category
    Then detailed breakdowns should show:
      | Diagnosis Category   | Avg Visits | Improvement | Meeting Threshold |
      | CVA rehabilitation   | 24.5       | 22 points   | Yes (>20 required)|
