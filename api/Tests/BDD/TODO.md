# BDD Test Implementation TODO - Infrastructure-First Approach

## Overview
This document tracks the comprehensive BDD test implementation for the Unified Pediatric Therapy Resource Management System (UPTRMS) using proper BDD methodology:
1. **Infrastructure First** - Set up Kubernetes (Kind), MSSQL, and supporting services
2. **Write Failing Tests** - Create tests for all 104 Gherkin scenarios that fail because code doesn't exist
3. **Implement Code** - Write just enough code to make tests pass (no hacks, placeholders, or TODOs)
4. **Quality Standards** - Achieve 100% code coverage, 100% acceptance criteria, and 0 linter errors
