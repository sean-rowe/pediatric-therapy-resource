## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

```
Project Name: Unified Pediatric Therapy Resource Management System (UPTRMS)
Project Code: PTRMS-2025-001
Version: 1.0
Status: DRAFT
Last Updated: June 14, 2025
Document Owner: [Director of Product Development]
Approval Chain: [CEO] → [CTO] → [VP Clinical Operations] → [CFO]

ONE PARAGRAPH: The Unified Pediatric Therapy Resource Management System (UPTRMS) is a comprehensive subscription-based digital platform that consolidates and delivers evidence-based therapy resources for occupational therapists (OT), physical therapists (PT), and speech-language pathologists (SLP) serving all age populations. The platform combines features from 20+ major therapy platforms to provide 100,000+ printable and digital resources, complete PECS and ABA implementation tools, AI-powered content generation for personalized therapy materials, marketplace functionality, automated therapy planning tools, comprehensive AAC systems, data collection capabilities, clinical supervision features, and continuing education modules, targeting a $47M addressable market of 515,300 therapy professionals. Implementation over 18 months will establish market leadership in the fragmented pediatric therapy resource space, with projected 3-year revenue of $14.2M and 85% gross margins.

KEY METRICS:
- 15,000 paid subscribers by Month 18
- 95% subscriber retention rate
- <3 second page load time for all resources
- 100,000+ unique resources available at launch (increased from 75K)
- $127 average revenue per user (ARPU)
- 500,000+ marketplace transactions annually
- 85% PECS phase completion rate
- 90% ABA data collection accuracy

CRITICAL RISKS:
1. Content licensing and copyright compliance for 50,000+ resources
2. Platform scalability to handle 100,000+ concurrent users
3. HIPAA/FERPA compliance for therapy planning and data collection features

  So that I can effectively implement all 6 phases with fidelity

  Background:
    Given I am trained in PECS methodology
    And I have students requiring AAC support
    And PECS materials are available digitally and physically

  @pecs-setup @phase1
  Scenario: Initialize PECS Phase 1 with reinforcer sampling
    Given I have a new student "Marcus" starting PECS
    When I begin reinforcer sampling
    And I document preferences:
      | Item Category | Specific Items      | Interest Level |
      | Food         | Goldfish crackers   | High          |
      | Toys         | Bubble gun          | High          |

      | Distance to book     | Increases from 1ft to across room |
      | Distance to partner  | Increases from 1ft to 10ft    |
      | Persistence         | Attempts when partner turned away |
    When Marcus meets Phase 2 criteria (80% over 3 days)
    And I introduce Phase 3 discrimination
    Then the system should support:
      | Activity Type        | Implementation                |
      | 2-picture discrimination | Preferred vs non-preferred |
      | Error correction     | 4-step correction procedure   |
      | Correspondence checks| Matching picture to item      |
      | Data collection      | Automatic accuracy calculation|
    And discrimination training should progress:
      | Stage | Pictures | Type                    |
      | 3A    | 2        | Highly preferred vs neutral|
      | 3B    | Multiple | Various preferred items    |

  @pecs-phase4-6 @advanced
  Scenario: Implement advanced PECS phases with sentence structure
    Given Marcus discriminates between 20+ pictures
    When I introduce Phase 4 sentence structure

      | "What do you want?"| Build and exchange sentence |
      | Visual prompt only | Initiate request independently|
    When advancing to Phase 6 commenting
    Then additional materials include:
      | Cards Added      | Purpose                      |
