Feature: Reporting and Analytics
  As a therapy practice stakeholder
  I want comprehensive reporting and analytics
  So that I can make data-driven decisions and demonstrate value

  Background:
    Given I have appropriate reporting permissions
    And the following data exists:
      | Category         | Volume                    |
      | Students        | 324 active               |
      | Sessions        | 4,836 last month         |
