## Success Criteria

Each phase is complete when:
1. All BDD tests for that feature are passing
2. Code coverage is above 80%
3. Performance benchmarks are met
4. Security scan shows no critical issues
5. Feature is documented
6. Feature is deployed to staging

## Notes

- Always implement the BDD tests first (they already exist)
- Work on one feature at a time to maintain focus
- Each feature should be fully complete before moving to the next
- Run all existing tests after each feature to prevent regression
- Deploy to staging after each phase for stakeholder review
- Adjust timeline based on team size and velocity
